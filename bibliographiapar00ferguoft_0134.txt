Hazspt-Schlzissel, or tenth book of the Arclzidoxa, pp. [30]
[2 blank} Title red and black.

Mook's transcription (No. 231) differs in the following
details: he puts a hyphen after Hand,· writes vnd anseres ‚·
nebst; Z asammt, and omits the date. I arn happy,
however, to be able to agree with Mook in his condemnation
of the portrait of Paracelsus which precedes the title-page.

This is apparently the fourth edition of a work which is
probably not by Paracelsus. The editions are : 1605

(Mook, No, 179), 1684 (see above, No. 145), 1715 <Mook,
No. 228), and the present one, 1736.

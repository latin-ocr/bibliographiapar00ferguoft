This is the first edition, so sar as Ι have ascertained.
There is no copy in the Eritish Museum, and the only
mention of it is by Will. Cooper, in his Catalogue os
Clzymz'call Books, London‚ 1675, sig. C2, from whom Ι
quoted it in Bz'bliograpllia Paracelsz'ca, 1877, No. 12. It is
not mentioned by Lowndes, either under “Key” or
“ Philosophy‚'' or under “ Hester, John‚'' the name of the
author or compiler. Watt does not quote this edition, but
only that os 1596. It is not in any library catalogue
which Ι have consulted, nor is it spoken of by either Arnes
or Herbert. If it exist at all, therefore, it must be os the
highest degree of rarity. For other parts and other editions

see under 1580, 1596, and 1633.

11.—1575. “ Joysull newes out of Heluetia, from Theophr. Para-
ceffum, declaring the ruinate sall os 1116 papall dignitie 3 also
a treatise against Vfury. By Steph. Batman.” Octavo.

This is given by Herbert (Tyssograplzical Antz'quz'tz'eS,
London, 1786, ΙΙ. p. 891) under John Allde, who was the
printer. From Herbert it is quoted by Watt and Lowndes‚
as Ι have already shown (Biblz'ograplzz’a Paracelsz'ca, 1877,
No. 48). It is not in the British Museum‚ and Ι have not

met with a copy elsewhere.

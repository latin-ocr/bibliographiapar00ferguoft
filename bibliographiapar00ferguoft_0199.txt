THE original draft of the present catalogue was meant
to be included in Bz'blz'ograplcz'a Paracelsz'ca, Part II.,
printed in 1885. It was at first a meagre list, devoid of
cross references, a bare counterpart of Mook's catalogue
and quite useless apart from it. It has been extended,
and I hope improved, by constant criticism and revision,
until it has got into its present shape. It is not the final
form of a catalogue of the kind, but it may serve till it

is superseded by one better and completer.

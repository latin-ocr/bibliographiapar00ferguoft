literature relating to the different parts of his system,
which is contained in the histories of philosophy, medicine,
and mysticism. It must not be forgotten, however, that
there are those who question the authenticity of some
of the theological opinions ascribed to Paracelsus. In

the elements arranging themselves according to their
tenuity. The heavenly fire formed the ether, and after-
wards the firmament and stars, of the air were produced

spiritual and vague existences; thewaters flowed together

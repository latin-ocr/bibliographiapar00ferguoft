magician at Salamanca or Toledo, who had great power
over spiritual existences‚ and from whom he learned some
valuable hints. Much farther was the journey which he
took to dispute upon the true theory of medicine with
Avicenna, who had been lying in his grave under the palm
trees at Hemdan about five hundred years. Such a journey
as this must be regarded as one of Paracelsus' richly
coloured descriptions of the controversy which he, all his
life through, waged with the Avicennists—or it may be
a statement by one of his too forward followers.

What adventures he met with upon these journeys there
is not probably any means now of knowing. He mixed
with all sorts of people, from the lowest to the highest;
for if his tastes and habits inclined him to associate with
the grosser sort, his skill, or at least his succeSS, made
him often consulted by princes and dukes, barons and
knights, for diseases which had baffled the physicians of
the time. These great people were not very profitable
connections. He was not always well used or generously
paid. Sometimes he was cheated out of his fee altogether
by those he attended or cured. No doubt there is ex-
aggeration on this point3 but that vow which Paracelsus
solemnly recorded tells too much of a wormwood experi-
ence for one to think that his grievances were imaginary.
Paracelsus, from his way of life, was not always present-
able in good company; he was far from being a courtier,
still farther from being a retainer or hanger-on of any man
of influence; his free expressions made him enemies, when
the least exercise of prudence would have rendered thern
either friendly to him, or without positive dislike. Thus

acting, however, would have changed his whole character,

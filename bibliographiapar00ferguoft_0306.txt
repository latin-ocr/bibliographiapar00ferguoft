character, and what were his philosophical and medical
opinions, a very considerable difficulty presents itself at
the outset. Of the voluminous writings which pass under
his name, what are really his work, and what, if not
actually composed by him, express his ideas? To this
question no complete critical reply has as yet been given,
though many opinions have been expressed. Dr. MarX,
for example, will admit only ten treatises as genuine.
Dr. Haeser allows seventeen for certain, a considerable
number—some twenty-four—as doubtful, and the rest—
he enumerates eleven—as spurious. Dr. Mook does not
accept these estimates, or the criteria by which the
genuineness of a treatise is ascertained. But neither does
he give altogether convincing criteria of his own, and,
what is still less satisfactory, he does not apply them——
such as they are—to decide the numerous doubtful cases.
The only thing Mook has done is to draw up a list of
the different editions of Paracelsus' so-called works. This
list is not complete in the enumeration of editions, and
it is quite imperfect in bibliographical description, but
with these and other serious defects it is the fullest at
present extant. The first book by Paracelsus was printed
at Augsburg in 1529. It is entitled Praclz'ca D. Tlleo-
phrasti Paracelsi, gemacht azff Europen, and forms a small
quarto pamphlet of five leaves. Prior to this, in 1526-27,
appeared a programme of the lectures he intended to
deliver at Basel, but this can hardly be reckoned a
specific work. During his lifetime fourteen works and
editions were published, and thereafter‚ between 1542
and 1845, there were at least two hundred and thirty-

four separate publications according to Mook's enumeration.

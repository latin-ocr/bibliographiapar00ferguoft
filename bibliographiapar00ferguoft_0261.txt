PARACELSUS.

PARACELSUS is a fortunate man3 his enemies were his
first biographers. By their exertions he has had every
one of his faults‚ every one of his delinquencie5‚ every one
of his sins and shortcomings carefully portrayed‚ minutely‚
almost lovingly described, unweariedly repeated. While
it is no use, therefore, for any subsequent historian to try
to make him out worse than he has been already depicted‚
an opportunity is thereby afforded to those who, whether
actuated by charity and wholesome scepticism to believe
him not so bad as has been said, or by perversity to think
differently from the mass, or by curiosity to examine the
statement5‚ the inferences, and the credibility of the
authorities, might be inclined to represent him as better.
Compared with those who repeat with indifference what
is detrimental to Paracelsus, the charitable and doubtful,
the perverse and curious are, it is true, in a minority; nor
is it difficult to see why. It is, generally speaking, easier
to copy what has been said before than to say something
new; it is less troublesome to reiterate statements than
to examine patiently the grounds on which they rest;
brilliant sarcasm and crushing invective, hard names and

mockery, come more easily to one's call than cautious

Τ116 pagination of the works has not been mentioned. It
is true that Mook usually tells us when a book is ποί paged‚
or, as he puts it, ‘unpaginirt,' or ‘ unpaginiert‚’ or ‘ohne
Seitenzahl,’ and he may have thought that if it was not
worth Paracelsus’ trouble to count the pages, it was not
worth his. But he might at least have enumerated the
sheets, as he has done in the first fifteen numbers. As to
the later printed books, which are undoubtedly paged, he

give all information about Paracelsus' writings as the
results of his own observation, he has thrown an air of
doubt over accounts of editions which he has quoted at
second hand; and he frequently states that the title or
date of some work given by 3 previous authority is erron-

eous, or imperfectly described, because, apparently, he has

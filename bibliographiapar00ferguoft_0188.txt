CORRRCTIONS AND ADDITIONS.

§3 In the previous parts I have observed some errors

which require correction. There may be others which I
have not yet detected.

Part II. p. 39, line 6, sor “ pp. 1 44‚'' read “ pp. 1-44.‘'

Part III. p. 9, line 14. sor “hm-kommem’· read “her-
l<ommcn.'’

Part ΙΙΙ. p. 11, No. 126.—[1567.] Since my last notice
os Leo Suavius' (jacques Gohory) edition of the De Visa
longa, I have got another copy of that very rare book. As
far as the contents go the two copies are identical, but the
third epistle <to Sangclasius) which, in No. 126, is placed
at the end, is, in this second copy, inserted in the middle
os the first sheet, just after the first epistle (to Renatus
Perotus). Does this shifting of the third epistle signify
that it was printed independently after the book was com-
plete, and placed wherever the owner or binder thought
most suitable ? *

The question that is still unanmvered, and presents some
difficulty, refers to the exact date of the edition. The

ἦ In the Basil edition of 1568, however, it is printed after the com-
mentary and before the index as an integral part of the book.

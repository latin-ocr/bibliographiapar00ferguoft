to give as much of a title as would serve for the identifica-
tion of any work or edition. Previous writers had tried to
do this, but, according to Mook, had failed3 for he com-
plains of the mangellzaste tz'telangabe of his predecessom, as
has been already said. The other method was to give the
titles in full. To this he was necessarily committed both
by his criticism and by his practice. Each method is
useful in its own way; the former yields a catalogue, the
latter a bibliography. Adelung and Graesse, for example,
have followed the former method‚ and their catalogues are
fairly passable. Mook has followed the second method,
and his bibliography is a comparative failure. It is not
meant that a particular book or edition cannot be identified
by Mook's list. It can be, easily—more easily, indeed,
than by any other list. What is meant is that Mook has
executed his own design so irregularly that not one single
title as given by him can be depended upon as representing
exactly what stands in the original work. His titles are
unnecessarily full for a mere catalogue; they are not
scrupulously accurate enough for a bibliography. If he
thought it desirable to give the whole title, why did he
depart at all from the form given by the author? He has
altered the punctuation, sometimes with an alteration of
the meaning 3 he has altered the spelling, usually modern-
ising it3 he has omitted portions of the title; he has added
portions to the title; sometimes he has given the date,
sometimes he has omitted it. Some of the changes noticed
in the preceding list are undoubtedly very trivial, and might
have been passed over. But it is Mook himself who has
set the example of litera] crsticism, for in one place (p. 23,

note 81) he observes that the form Basz'lz'ae occurs instead

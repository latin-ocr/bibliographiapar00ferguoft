Howell, (?) John French or Freake‚ (?) W. D„ H. Pinnell,
R. Turner, must be considered as Paracelsus’ discipleS‚ who
made some of his writings accessible to students in this
country. To them the mere English reader must still re-
pair‚ if he desire to have some notion of Paracelsus’ views,
for nothing by Paracelsus and very little about him, has
appeared in this country for the last two hundred
years. The student, however, will have to exercise patience,
considerable patience, before he can become the gratified
possessor of the little volumes. They are all extremely
rare and some of them seem quite unattainable. There are,
indeed, not many books of the seventeenth century so diffi-
cult to lay hands on as the translations of Paracelsus.
Besides those enumerated here which were printed, there
were others, of which translations were made or making,

but, so far as I know, they never saw the light as printed
books. MSS. of these may survive, but I have not yet had

opportunity of making a research on this subject. One
cannot help regretting that Richard Russell‚ who by 1678
had translated two and a half out of the three volumes of
Paracelsus' works, either did not live to finish his trans-
lation, or did not get the necessary encouragement to
publish it. I may hereafter recur to this part of the
bibliography.

In the following list Ι have thought it unnecessary to
reprint the titles which have been given already at full

length in the general catalogue, and have contented myself
with referring to these. Remarks, however, have been

added in all cases where Ι have acquired additional
information since the titles were originally printed.

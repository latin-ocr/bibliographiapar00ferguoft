The copy—a very fine one—from which the preceding
has been taken is in the British Museum (1032. d. Ι) and
it is the only one in that or any public library which has
been consulted in compiling the present list. Exception

has been made in its favour for several reasons.

1. Mook did not see it, and the present description there·
fore may fill a gap in Paracelsian bibliography.

2. The editor, Gohory‚ was a singular person, and his
works are worth remembering, for their curiosity and great
rarity.

3. The date of the first edition has caused Mook some
trouble. He knew only the 1568 edition (see No. 60 below),
and on the strength of it as well as from contempt for
Marx has all but refused (p. 13, note 50) to admit the
existence of a Paris edition of 1567, cited by Marx. How
fallacious Mook's argument is was pointed out before
(Bibliograplzia Paracalsim, 1877, No. 2 3), and it was shown
by a quotation from Graesse that on this occasion Marx
might possibly be correct. The 1566 edition Mook has
relegated to a note (p. 48, Bern. c), where it is quoted on

Adelung's authority.

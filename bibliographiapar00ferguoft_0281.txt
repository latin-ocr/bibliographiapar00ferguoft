and became the ocean, and gave deposits of salt, coral,
even fishes and sirens3 the earthy principle formed the
solid parts of the world, and gave rise to all kinds of
rocks and stones, plants, animals‚ gnomes, and giants.
As all these objects were produced at the same time,
from the same material, and by the same proceSS‚ they
have, of necessity, an inner connection with each other,
and a community of qualities; many of these qualities
are obvious, but many are discovered only by intense
scrutiny, while some are so recondite that they completely
baffle man in his attempt to follow them out. Every
part of the universe is thus a mirror of every other part.
The great world, and all the smaller worlds‚ are part
and parcel of the same Divine Creation‚ and every future
existence is accordingly conditioned by its antecedents.
When matter was made into discrete portions, man was
constructed. All the qualities of every individual thing
were brought together and heaped upon him. In the
most multifarious ways he has thus become an embodi-
ment of the outer and greater world. The macrocosmus
is reflected mediately and immediately in him, the micro-
cosmus. Every part of his body is thus connected directly
with some planet or star, some herb, or mineral, or metal,
and as these are connected with each other, he is in
contact with nature several times over. Hence every
part of the world re-acts on every other part, and man,
especially, is subject both to the terrestrial and to the
higher influences

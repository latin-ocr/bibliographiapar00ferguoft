Saturn and the belt of Orion! A body, from the con-
templation of which an archangel could infer the entire
inorganic universe as the simplest of corollaries!⁷'

Upon all parts of nature, then, man depends for the
maintenance of his body.‘ Resides a body, however, man
also possesses a spirit and a soul. Thus, consisting of
three parts, he is like the rest of the world, an embodiment
of the threefold constitution of all things derived from the

they foster, warm, and regulate; but as representatives of
the super-sensual light of nature, they act as “Astra ’' em-

mind, there are many co-operating influences—the inherited
qualities of the parents, and the external power of the
elements‚ and of the “Astra,'' so that the character of the
individual is determined by the balance of influence in

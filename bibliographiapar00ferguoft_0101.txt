books undated really are put under certain years, on the
strength of the date at the end of some dedicatory epistle‚
or of the preface. Altogether it cannot be said that
Mook’s treatment of dates is by any means successful and

satisfactory and consistent, and the same may be said of
other details as well.

§6 (3) omission of Antlmrities. As I have deliberately
avoided quotation from bibliographers in the present list,
and have confined myself to actual copies of the books,
I have nothing to add to what was said on this subject
in the former part.

Mook only certifies¹ books that he has seen, and his
authorities are the copies in different libraries. He him-
self says that Wolfenbuttel was one of the few European
libraries he did not visit. To these unvisited libraries Ι
am inclined to add the British Museum, notwithstanding

Mook’s frequent references to it.

37. (4) Completeness. Upon this point also there is no
more to say than that Mook has missed more than a score
of the books mentioned in the preceding. Two or three
cannot fairly be considered as Paracelsian works, and
Mook has correctly omitted them; others are reprints,
which he ought not to have ignored; a few are quite un-
known to him, and of others he knows the titles only at
second hand. Some of the English books have escaped
him, and this is singular; for if he had paid attention to
those in the British Museum he would have filled up
several blanks in his list.

38. From what has now been said, it appears to me that

my original conclusions are more than confirmed.

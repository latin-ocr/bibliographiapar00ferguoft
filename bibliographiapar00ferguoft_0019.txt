meration of all the works which have appeared under the

any particular work said to be by Paracelsus, and the
decision‚ whether or not it is genuine.

ἓ 4. In this study the author deals with his subject in
three corresponding sections. An introduction contains a
statement of the question, and examples of the criticisms
which have been passed on Paracelsus With this part of
his work, and especially with the remarks which the author
makes on the history of science as compared with that of
philosophy, literature, art, nations‚ though not always with
the tone of the criticism, Ι on the whole ag1·ee.2 It is not
at all exhaustive in the enumeration of Paracelsus’ critics,
but it was not necessary to make it fuller than it is.
Enough is shown of the troubled and murky ocean of
doubt and contradiction which the would-be biographer

and critic of Paracelsus have to navigate.3

² Some remarks on the same subject will be found in an opening address to
the Chemical Section of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow, December, 1875.

3 Paracelsus, from his life, character, and range of ideas, plays a part in
the history of immunem, philosophy, science‚ and medicine, and as he offers
scope for picturesque description, he is the theme of many essays, both critical
and popular. The following, not referred to by Mook, besides many of those

copy of this last issue, which, like that of 1661, consists
merely of certain copies of the 1660 edition with a new
title-page. This edition is omitted by Mook and Ι do not
know where another copy, besides that which has been

now described, is to be found.

xxm—1674. A New Light of Alchymy: . . . also Nine Books of
theNature of Things, written by Paracelsus‚ . . . translated
. . . by J. F.

This is an 8vo reprint of the 1650 edition of the same
collection. The description is given in Part Ι. 1877,
No. 1o.

tises . . . by . . . Dr. Aurelius Philipus Theophrastus
Paracelsus, of Hoheneim. Publish'd by John Headrich.

Quoted first from the Bodleian Catalogue (Biblz'ograplcz'cz

Pamcelsica, 1877, No. 41), afterwards described from an

actual copy (Part II. 1885, No. 114).

XXIV.——s. a. Philosophical and Chyrnical Treatise of Fire and Salt.

This book is ascribed to Paracelsus by Will. Cooper, but
I have not had the fortune to meet with a copy. There is
another work with a similar title by Blaise de Vigenere,
London‚ 1649, small 4⁰, but whether they are different or

not Ι am unable to say.

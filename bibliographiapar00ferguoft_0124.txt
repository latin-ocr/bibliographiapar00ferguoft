Mook (No. 71) reproduces this title correctly‚ but omits
the privilege clause, and makes some changes in typography
and in punctuation.

Anno M.D.Lxx.

Small 8vo, ff. 47. s. 48 is occupied with the picture of
a monster : a woman with wings, and covered with feathers,
except on the head, arms, breast and legs. The legs ter-
minate in cloven feet, which are also winged. There are
two eyes at the waist 1 Under the picture is the colo-
phon : Excusum anno post Christum natum, M.D.Lxx.
There is no place or printer mentioned. The volume con-
tains a series of 30 symbolical pictures, No. 30 serving also
as a title vignette.

This—the Wodhull Copy—-came into my possession
shortly after Part ΙΙ. of the Bz'blz'ograplzz'a Paracelsmz was
printed, and, on looking at its very brief title, Ι could not
help thinking that surely this at least would be given
accurately by Mook. But on referring to his list (No. 78)
Ι found that fate was still against him: he has Nurembezgae
for erenbergae of the original, and has omitted the stop
before Per, writing that word with a lower case p.
132.—157o. Ettliche Tractatus Des Hocherfarnen vnnd berfimbt-

esten Philippi Theophrasti Paracelsi, der waren Philosophi
vnd Artzney Doctoris.

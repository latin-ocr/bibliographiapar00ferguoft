region of knowledge, it should act rather as an incentive
to investigate all things, for he is formed to speak of
the wonderful things of creation. And here he must use
both experience and science. If he will have reliable
knowledge, theory and practice must be combined.
Separate‚ they are of no avail, for theory is but specu-
lative practice, and practice but applied theory. An
experiment without science has no weight or worth—it
is not reliable3 but he who has science can trust it,
because he knows the reason why things are so. Thus,
while founding on experiment, one must rise to causes,
and so escape the danger of mere fanciful hypothesis
unbased on experiment‚ or of working upon a pure
theory without right observation of Nature.

This is the work of philosophy, which has to investi-
gate all nature3 in other words, Nature is concrete or
visible philosophy 3 philosophy is unseen Nature. The
knowledge of the great world is the foundation for that
of man, and the philosopher has to trace the relations
between them—all the heavenly and earthly forces which
emanate from natural objects, and work on man.

And now, having investigated the relations of the
Universe‚ and laid his foundations of knowledge in God
and the faculties of man, the next and noblest art is to
keep man in the highest state of perfection.

The Art of Medicine is thus based, according to
Paracelsus: (Ι) In Theology; (2) In Philosophy3 (3) In
Astronorny or Meteorology3 and (4) In Alchemy——which
is the art of so dealing with matter that its properties
become, in the first place, perfect, and then of use for heal-

ing—a sort of refined or transcendental pharmacy.

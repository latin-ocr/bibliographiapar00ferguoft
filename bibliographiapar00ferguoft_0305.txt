first to Esslingen, where he remained for a brief period.
but had soon to leave from absolute want. Then began
his wandering life, the course of which can be traced by
the dates of his various writings. He thus visited in
succession Colmar, Nuremberg, AppenzelL Zurich, Pf'affers,
Augsburg, Villach, Meran, Middelheim, and other places,
seldom staying a twelvemonth in any of them. In this
way he spent some dozen years, till 1541, when he was
invited by Archbishop Ernst to settle at Salzburg, under
his protection. After his endless tossing about, this seemed
a promise and place of repose. It proved, however, to
be the complete and final rest that he found, for after a few
months he died on the 24th of September. The cause of
his death, like most other details in his history, is un-

tavern in consequence of a drunken debauch of some
days' duration. Others maintain that he was thrown
down'a steep place by some emissaries either of the
physicians or of the apothecarieS, both of whom he had
during his life most grievously harassed. In proof of
this, surgeons have pointed out in Paracelsusâ€™ skull a
flaw or fracture, which could have been produced only
during life. Authorities, however, are not agreed on this
point, and it may be simplest to suspend belief until
more evidence is got. He was buried in the churchyard
of St. Sebastian, but in 1752 his bones were removed to
the porch of the church', and a monument of reddish-

white marble was erected to his memory.

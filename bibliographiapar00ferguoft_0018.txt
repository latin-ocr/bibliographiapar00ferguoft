Brande, take on the whole the other side; at all events
their language is less vehement; and Liebig goes the
length of asserting that “even now the system of Galen
and Paracelsus rules . . . over the minds of most physi-

forms of expression.” It has been long known, though
Dr. Mook has very properly pointed it out again, that
these unfavourable criticisms are traceable to a few primary
sources. Oporinus, Eiastus, Conring, have been the oracles
whom subsequent writers have repeated at first, second,
third, fourth hand, with hardly ever 3 doubt if they
were unbiassed and reliable, if the stories were in them-
selves true, if the works of l'aracelsus they quoted were
authentic.

opinion about Paracelsus? Why is it that no one has
satisfactorily decided whether Paracelsus was a quack or a
genius? Mook ascribes it to the mass of writings which
pass under Paracelsus' name, and which have never been
sifted to separate the authentic from the spurious. It may
be questioned if this be 3 sufficient explanation, but it is ’

long as the genuine writings are doubtful, 3 view of Para-

cribed or denied to him wrongly. The first business of the
critic, then, is to ascertain what are Paracelsus' genuine
writings. and this, according to Mook, involves three things:

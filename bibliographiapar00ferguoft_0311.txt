him. Probably therefore his positive services are to be
summed up in this wide application of chemical ideas
to pharmacy and therapeutics; his indirect and possibly
greater services are to be found in the stimulus, the
revolutionary stimulus, of his ideas about method and
general theory. It is not difficult‚ however, to criticise
Paracelsus and to represent him as so far below the
'level of his time as to be utterly contemptible. It is
difficult, but perhaps not impossible, to raise Paracelsus
to a place among the great spirits of mankind. It is
most difficult of all to ascertain what his true character
really was, to appreciate aright this man of fervid
imagination, of powerful and persistent convictions, of
unbated honesty and love of truth, of keen insight into
the errors (as he thought them) of his time, of a merciless
will to lay bare these errors and to reform the abuses
to which they gave rise, who in an instant offends us by
his boasting, his grossness‚ his want of sels-respect. It
is a problem how to reconcile his ignorance, his weakness‚
his superstition, his crude notions, his erroneous observa-
tions, his ridiculous inferences and theories, with his grasp
of method, his lofty views of the true scope of medicine,
his lucid statements, his incisive and epigrammatic
criticisms of men and motiveS.

A character full of contradictory elements cannot but
have had contradictory judgments passed on it; and
after three hundred years the animus is as strong and

the judgments are as diverse as ever.

with sels-determination; everything worked and moved
by its connection with the original Source of Life.

The term quintessence was employed by Paracelsus,
not to denote a fifth element, but rather to express the
dominating element of a thing; that which gives it its
special virtue and character. It especially denoted,
therefore, the healing virtue of a mineral or plant.

In this system, as has been already noticed, man
occupies an altogether peculiar position. He is emphati-

his relations are the most complex. Everything in the
great world has its analogue in man, so that to compre-
hend him we require a knowledge of all things. He
consists of two parts—the visible, elementary body, and
a sidereal spirit—and in this he agrees with animals.
But he has, besides, the immortal part which is directly
from God, and through this he is raised to the knowledge
of Divine things and love.

This soul is the centre of man, and is located in the
heart. Round it is ranged the inferior parts of man—
while, in the soul itself, is the very essence of the soul,
the mind which seems to have almost denoted the
conscience, the judge of right and wrong.

Now, as can be easily seen, these different parts of
man’s nature are related to the corresponding parts of
the outer world, and they perform different functions.
The astral spirit, for example, is nourished from the
astral world, and by spiritual influences, and to it belongs
natural reason, art, and wisdom. It is of importance
therefore for man to keep his nature pure, so that he

may draw these influences, and be enabled to commune

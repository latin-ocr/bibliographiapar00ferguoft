§4 It will be objected that the strict alphabetical
order has not been always observed. That is correct;
but in those cases Ι have thought it more important to
enumerate the successive editions by their dates, than to
arrange them alphabetically merely to suit perhaps some
arbitrary variation in the spelling, or modification of
the title, which would certainly have had the effect of
separating related books or editions from one another
with hardly any compensation in increased ease of refer-
ence. While, therefore, the general arrangement is alpha-
betical by the first main word of the title, Ι have not
hesitated under particular titles to depart from this, and
adopt a chronological order for the sake of exhibiting
successive editions. By this plan, too, it is made possible
to form some notion of the importance or popularity of
a work by observing the number of editions of it. I do
not think that in any case the alphabetical dislocation
is such that it will cause greater inconvenience than what
would result from having to consult a number of cross
references.

ἕ5. It may be as well to explain the details of the
catalogue.

1⁰. The first column, headed “No.'', refers to the running num-
bers under which Mook has given the title and description
of the books. As in all these cases Mook saw actual
copies in the libraries he mentions, the books exist, and
are authenticated by him.

2⁰. The second column, headed ‘⁶ Page,” refers to the page, and,
when the number is followed by a letter, to the note on the
page, in which Mook quotes editions he had not himself
seen and the existence of which, therefore, he could not
guarantee, but which he had found mentioned by other
writers, such as Adelung, Spachius‚ Gesner, etc, and
gives on their authority. Every book, therefore, in the
following list, opposite such a figure alone, must be

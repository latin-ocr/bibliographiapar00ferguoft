land, where magic was the common gift of all ; they really
had some knowledge of what herbs were poisonouS, and
what healing. The barbers were also surgeons, and the
symbol of their ancient union may still be seen at the
shop doors of their modern representatives. In our days
of accumulated learning, the teachers of a past time are
themselves subjected to examination. Even from the
gipsies the garb of mystery is almost at last stripped. But
when Paracelsus met them in his wanderings over Europe,
the very tone of mind which sees nothing as too mean for
examination was not yet dreamed of, much less in opera-
tion as now.

To a man of Paracelsus' nature, academical distinction
could not present great attraction, and it thus remains
questionable if he ever graduated at any university. Upon
this, as on most other points of his personal history, we are
left swimming in a turmoil of contradictions and proba-
bilities. He says in one place, that of the great seminaries
he visited he was a distinguished ornament—in others he
cries out against the doctors of his time, in his valiant
preaching down of shams: “What good does a name do?
—a title, a high school, if we have not high skill to boot?
It is the skill that makes the physician‚ not the name or
the school. What the better are we that we enjoy great
deserence and live in grand style, if we are lacking in art ?
What is there in the high school which is not to be found
in the low? Is a higher wisdom‚ a higher piety taught
yonder? Ah, very likely. Yonder are enthroned Potentes,
in whom is no truth, no wisdom, no pity3 but only falsity,
truculence, rascality. But what does it matter to me

whether the high schools choose to follow me or not?

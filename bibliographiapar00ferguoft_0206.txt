“Natiirlichen (von) Dingen’' is entered sour times when
one entry and the cross reference would have been
sufficient.

57. Ι have little doubt that, notwithstanding my efforts
to be accurate, misprints, slips in figures, omission of
cross references, possibly even of titles‚ and other defects
will be met with. I hope that none of these will be
misleading or will form a drawback to the use of the list.

Ι am aware also that the list is very far from complete,
and does not represent all Paracelsus’ works that are
known. Mook describes 248 editions which he saw, be—
sides those he quoted from other writers, which were
doubtful to him. Drs, Schubert and Sudhoffi how—
ever, say ³¹⁵ that they have seen 118 editions not quoted by
Mook, including many against the existence of which he
has argued3 that they possess 201 editions; that they
have examined 349 editions; and they calculate that
altogether the number of the editions of Paracelsus’ works
may amount to about 450, or fully 200 more than Mook
described.†

No account of these editions is given anywhere, so far as
Ι know. One can only hope that a fuller bibliography
than any that has yet appeared will be published some
day. When that comes it will be time to draw up a
new alphabetical list which will embrace the additional

titles as well as those now given.

58. Originally 1 had the intention of giving cross
references to the collected works. The compilation of
these would have added much to the extentos my
labour, it would have increased the complexity of the
list, and as it would have involved the use of a larger
collection of Paracelsus’ works than can be commanded
even in the British Museum‚ it would have postponed

ἥ Paracclsus-Forsclzungen, Frankfurt, 1887, Erstes Hest, p. 14.

† Some of these may be in the British Museum‚ but I have not yet examined
that collection.

absolutely worthless, because most, if not all, of the works
could be identified, though obviously not the editions,
seeing that no dates are given. It seems unfairâ€š therefore,
to appraise a mere outline-list like the present, without any

sixteenth century. Leo Suavius' short commentary Mook
calls a vindication of Paracelsus' fecundity in book making
by the example of others who have been equally prolific.

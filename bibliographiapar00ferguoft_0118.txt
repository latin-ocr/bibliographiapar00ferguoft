tion of that edition (No. 62) he quotes as on p. 147 the
dedicatory epistle of Suavius to Capella, and carefully adds
that it is dated: “Lutetiae Parisiorum. Kal. July (sic)
Anno 1567.'’ But he does not notice that this date is
eleven months after the date of the letter to Perotus‚ which
he knew was also in the Basel edition, for he mentions it.
Yet in the above note Mook does not indicate that he
thinks it possible that an earlier Paris edition might contain
the 1567 letter, as well as that of 1566, but trusting to
Adelung has put down 1566 as a probable date.

As Adelung's statement is the only authority for a 1566
edition, and as it rests, Ι believe, on an imperfect examina-
tion of the book, there is no need, merely to save Ade-
lung’s accuracy‚ to assume actual, or to speculate about
possible inaccuracy in the date of the second letter. It
seems more judicious to accept the year of the second
letter, 1567, 35 correct, and not to admit the existence of an
edition of 1566, until a copy having no earlier or later date
in it, has been found and described.

But whether there be a 1566 edition or not, there is still
the question whether the edition of 1567 appeared at first
with or without the third letter. To this there is no con-
clusive answer forthcoming; it is, perhaps² rather more
probable that the book was first issued, like the Museum
copy, without the letter, which was afterwards inserted in
some remaining copies, than that it contained the letter
originally and was for some reason latterly issued without .
it. That the signature is the same as that of the sheet
which follows, does not, I think, help us to either conclusion.
Thus, while the fact of there being two issues is undoubted‚
why there should have been two remains in the meantime
an unsolved bibliographical problem. In any case the
third letter is subsequent to the other two, and would

In his remarks he repeats the word Meteornm, and he
divides the motto thus ε Pax vivis—requies—aeterna sepultis,
This division is not only different from that in the above
copy, but seems to me impossible, if the words are printed
on each side of the coat of arms, in two lines as indicated by
the dashes.

Since describing (Bibliograplcia Paracelszka, Part ΙΙ. 1885,
No. 55) the British Museum copy of what 1 considered to be
the Paris, 1566, edition of this book, I have got the present
copy which introduces a new difficulty and necessitates a

detail ; they belong in fact to the same edition, so that the
title—page and collation already given (No. 55) apply to this
copy. The difference between the two is that in the present
copy, between the close of the text on p. 376 and the Index
rernm which follows on *i recto, there is interpolated a
sheet of four leaves, having also the signature *‚ and contain-
ing an epistle from J(acques) G(ohory) (zle. Leo Suavius) 2

At first sight it looks as if an edition had been printed
about 1566, and that somewhat later this epistle had been
written and had been inserted in the remainder copies,

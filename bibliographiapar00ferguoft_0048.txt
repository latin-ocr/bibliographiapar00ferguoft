Paracelsus' lifetime with Huser’s reprints, and with what
Huser says about the sources he made use of, he believes
himselfjustified in the conclusion that there is absolutely
no reason to throw doubt of any kind upon Huser’s
trustworthiness. Hence—

genuine which, tried by the previous tests‚ bear undoubted
marks of authorship, both as regards matter and form''——

312. In modification of what has been said above
(No. 128, and elsewhere) about Mook's use of the British
Museurn‚ I am glad to be able to refer to the Paracelsus-
Forsclzngelz of Drs. Eduard Schubert and Karl Sudhoff,
printed at Frankfurt, 1887-89. Two parts are already
published, for copies of which I am indebted to the kind-
'ness and courtesy of the authors. The first part is a defence
of Mook against the criticism of Dr. Rohlss3 the second con-
tains MS. documents illustrative of Paracelsus’ biography.

The first part bears directly on Mook’s character as a
bibliographer, a subject which has been specially considered
by me, hitherto. The authors do not conceal or palliate
any of Mook's faults, but they show conclusively that
Rohlfs' criticism is not justified either in tone or in matters
of fact. With their vindication of Mook from such criticism
I thoroughly agree. Mook lead all kinds of shortcomings,
as Ι have myself demonstrated, but it would be unjust to
deny him the credit of having drawn up the fullest and,
with all its defects, the most correct catalogue of Para-
celsus‘ works which has as yet appeared, and that too from
actual personal inspection of the books. There can be no
question about this.

But they have also shown that Mook was very negligent,
and' that he overlooked in the libraries he visited books
and editions which with more attentive examination of the
catalogues he could not have missed. This he did, for
example, conspicuously in the Frankfurt town library,
where are two copies of a collected German edition of
Paracelsus’ works, printed at Frankfurt‚ by Wechel's heirs,
1603, in ten volumes‚ quarto, which he never saw. So
heedlessly has Mook allowed these books to escape him
that the authors (p. 89) call it one of the most striking

proofs of Mook’s “ oft kopflosen Oberflachlichkeit.''

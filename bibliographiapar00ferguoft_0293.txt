Paracelsus’ character and work—when we compare him
with some of his contemporaries—with Agricola and
Palissy on the one hand, or on the other with Luther,
as has been done by one of his countrymen-we find
the task by no means a simple one. If one praises
Paracelsus for anything, one is obnoxious to the accusa-
tion of theosophist, or cabalist‚ or mystic; and yet
historical fairness will not suffer us to ignore the enormous
influence he has exercised. It is not possible to point
to any great discovery of facts that he made. His
knowledge, indeed, even for his time, was vague, inaccurate,
and imperfect. Agricola, his contemporary, wrote a book
on mining and metallurgy, which is valuable for its facts,
even at the present day. Palissy‚ his contemporary,
not only discovered the pottery which bears his name,
and which is so beautifully designed‚ and glazed, and
coloured, but he was one of the most original of rnen,
with the coolest judgment, the clearest observation, the
most rational in his deductions from observed facts;
yet Agricola and Palissy‚ for all the influence they
exerted on their own or any subsequent age, might never
have lived. But we cannot say the same of Paracelsus,
He no sooner appeared than he influenced men. He
broke through the traditions which had fettered all
physicians as hopelessly as the Church had settered man-
kind. Prior to Luther were many attempts at Church
reform. Before Paracelsus, so far as one knows, there
were none in medicine; and this impulse, as has been
already said, did not die out after Paracelsus' death.
His doctrines were taken up and advocated by many men,
by Van Helmont, Quercetanus, Thurneysser, Libavius‚ and

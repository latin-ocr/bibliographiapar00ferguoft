“Ende dess Vierdten.'' This correction being
made, the second copy agrees exactly with the
description.

80.-—Volume V. In the account of this volume it
should have been specified that sheet 05) (pp. 289-
296) contains five leaves instead of four, an extra
leaf with signature O5)ij, but not paged, being
inserted between pp. 290-2913 and also, that in the
Appendix, pp. 177-178 are printed on a folding
leaf, which is not included in the signatures. With
the original description as well as with these addi-
tions the second copy agrees exactly.

81.—Volume VI. This agrees with the description.

82.—-Volume VII. The second copy differs from the
description by the following version of line 20 of

Index, are different. In the first copy they run:
kk7)‚ L7>ij‚ ll7)iij‚ where the L and ll are mis-
prints for kk. In the second copy they run : L7)‚
L7)ij‚ ll7)iij‚ all of which are misprints for kk.
Ι infer from the preceding that some copies were
printed off before the mistakes above quoted were
noticed‚ that the press was afterwards corrected and
other copies then printed.

83.-—Volume VIII. In the former description, for:
‘⁶ lncz'ex...Separatin1..,Habebitvr,'’ read “Index...
Sffaralim...Halaebitvrs’ The second copy agrees
with the description so far as it goes, but it has
besides an Appendix, pp. 365-428‚ which is wanting
in the other. The second copy contains also the
portrait, of which the other has been deprived.

84.—Volu1ne IX. The first copy has 6 prelirninary pages
only, but when complete it should have other two
with the contents of the first volume of the ‘⁶ Phil-
osophia.” The second copy has these pages, and
the two copies agree in all other respects except

tute of interest 35 3 study in comparative criticism. Few
men have elicited from critics, biographers, and historialis ι
111016 conflicting judgments than Paracelsus. By 501116,
perhaps by most, he is denounced as a quael< 011116
first order; by 0111615, 116 15 regarded as a genius, as a
great 1610111161 01 medicine; and between the extremes
01 good and bad are to be found the intermediate 6511-
1113165 011655 enthusiastic 6111165. To the curious collection
of opinions exhibited by Dr. Mook, it would be easy to
add those of others 111110 113ν6 considered it their duty,
and perhaps their privilege, to tilt at the supposed 106 01
sobriety of thought and manners. Long ago Dr. WValter
Harris, Felloxv of the College of l'hysicians, reviewed

him in manner 31111 form following· :—

“ Pa7'acel52157 35 11111611 35 116 nuignified himself 101 his great
store 01Ανι1υῐα, and despised others 101 want 01 1116 531116 Ρ16-
1611510115, yet if we state things a little calmly, we shall find, that
116 11111 1101 50 really promote the Honour and Glory of Clcymisffiy,
as he vainly boasted, or would have had the World believe. . .
He set upon Resm‘ming Plzysz'ck, with all 1116 Μ31166, 31111 Ill—will,
with all the 11311611 and Contempt, that a Beast 31111 3 Sot could
possibly conceive against Saher 111611, whose Sem'ousness and
Sobm'ety was the greatest Reproaclz, and declaration of Enmity to
his dissolute and profligate Life. . . . But know bold Wretch
[f. a, Paracelsus]‚ their Names [i. c.‚ Galen's Avicenna’s, Rhasis’‚
Montagnana's‚ Mesue's, &c.] will be Consecrated to after-ages,
and had in good Reputation by Wise‚ and Sober men, when thy
Bombaslz'ck Names shall perish and be despised, when thy frantick
folly, and miserable vanity‚ and ill—nature, shall with thy Dust
be trampled upon by all men. . . .” ¹

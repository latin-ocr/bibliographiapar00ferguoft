have been dated now January 1568. It is quite certain
that the Basel edition of 1568 is subsequent to these.

This book, however, apart from its own history, is of the
greatest importance as vindicating Marx's accuracy against
Mook’s criticism‚ and for this purpose it makes no differ-
ence whether or not there be a 1566 edition, so long as it
can be proved that there was a Paris edition prior to that
of Basel, 1568. Ι have referred to this matter before
(Bz'blz'ograpllz'a Paracelsz'ca, 1877, No. 23, and Part IL, 1885,
No. 55). It may be remembered that Marx, having
occasion to quote Leo Suavius’ catalogue of Paracelsus'
works, referred to a 1567 edition of the Compendz'mlz. But
Mook, knowing only the BaseL 1568, edition, in doubt
about a previous Paris edition and refusing to accept of
anything on Marx's authority, took up a quite unreasonable
and indefensible position with regard to Marx’s quotation.
He not only tried to convict him of error because the
edition of 1568 did not contain what Marx had quoted
from an edition of 1567, but he even doubted altogether
the existence of a 1567 edition, both because he did not
know it, and more particularly because Marx had quoted it.
Graesse, however, in 1864, had adduced a priced copy of this
edition from Scheible‚ and in 1877, long before I had seen
the book itself,I brought forward this quotation as proof
that such an edition must almost certainly exist, and now Ι
have given a description of two copies printed at Paris before
1568. Mook, therefore, has failed to catch Marx tripping
in the date of the edition he used, and as the Basel edition
of 1568, which Mook admits is the only one he knew, is
quite different from that of Paris, it affords no ground
whatever for the reflection he has cast upon Marx's
accuracy; it was, indeed, quite irrelevant to adduce it as a
criterion at all.

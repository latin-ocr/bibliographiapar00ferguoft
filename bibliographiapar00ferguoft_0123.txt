why does he not say that it was one of the European
Libraries 116 did not visit ? Lastly, if the title, as he gives
it, does not exist in any copy, whatever -claim can be put
forward for him as an accurate bibliographer is entirely
destroyed, if he could make such an addition to the title-
page of a book from its table of contents. But see “ Cor-
rections and additions‚'’ g 12.

As my copy is bound up with Perna's edition of the
Cmnpendz'mn, 1568, and as the two works have been
obviously printed about the same time, I have indicated
1568 as an approximate date. Mook (p. 62, Bemerkung
b)) quotes Gesner as assigning this book to 1570. Mook
himself, however, puts it among the undated editions (No.
247) and for once reproduces the title quite correctly, with
the exception of the comma omitted aster serpentibus, and
the privilege clause, which is also left out.

is one of the most mutilated titles which Mook has given,

so far as my comparison has gone. Years before I had
seen this book I had referred to it (Bz’bliograplzia Para—
celsz'ca, Part I., 1877, p. 16) in illustration of the doubt
which Mook's method of transcription had called up as to
whether the etc. belonged to the title originally or was intro-
duced by Mook himself. Here again it turns out, as in
No. 136, and others, that the etc. does not belong to the
title, but is used inaccurately to signify omissions, and
the same remark holds good, that if Mook thought certain
titles were too long to be given in their entirety he should
have chosen some other notation than etc. to indicate the

omitted portions.

142.—1633. The Secrets of Physick and Philosophy, . . . first
written . . . by . . . Theophrastus Paraselsus‚ and now
published in the English Tongue by John Hester.

For the description of this work, see the English
editions, ἓ 4, IX.
143.—1653. Medicina Diastatica.

For the description of this work, see the English
editions, g 4, XIII. The British Museum, 1036, a. 18,
contains a copy.

144—1663. Paracelsus His Archidoxis, Or, Chief Teachings3
Comprised in Ten Books, . . .
Londcm, . . . 1663.

Here ought to be given the account of this edition of the
Arclcz'doxes, which I quoted formerly (Bz'bliograpllica Para-
celsz'ca, 1877, No. 8) from Will. Cooper, and a copy of which
I have recently acquired. I have preferred, however, to
insert it in the list of English translations, where it can be
more easily compared with the editions dated 1660 and
1661. See ἓ 4, XXI.

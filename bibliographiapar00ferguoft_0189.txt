work itself is not dated, but it contains two epistles dated
respectively August 1566, and July 1567, and the third
epistle above mentioned of January 1567 (i.e. 1568). That
the date cannot be 1566 Ι have already shown, but whether
it is 1567, or really 1568, depends upon whether Gohory's
third epistle did or did not belong to the book when it
appeared originally. As my two copies each contain the
third epistle, I suppose they are to be considered as
published subsequent to January 1567 (1568). The British
Museum copy wants this epistle, and the latest date it con-
tains is July 1567. Was a portion of the edition actually
issued without the third epistle, and is the Museum copy
one of that portion; or, was the whole edition held back
till the third epistle was ready, and does the Museum copy
happen to be merely one which was overlooked when
the epistle was added? WVhen this same question as
to copies with and without the third epistle was under con-
sideration before (No. 126), the answer was given in ex-
planation—rather too strongly, perhaps—that there must
have been two issues. The possibility now stated had not
suggested itself to me, and there may be other alternatives
still. This, however, makes the wished-for decision all the
more difficult to be arrived at, for, so far as I know at
present, there are no facts bearing upon it.

On the same occasion (No. 126) I omitted to state that
in these three epistles Gohory had made dedication of his
book to three different persons.

In the first epistle to Renatus Perotus, he confides his
four books of Scholia on the De Vita longa to him in terms
most friendly and flattering, and thereafter gives expression

to his admiration of Paracelsus. This epistle is dated

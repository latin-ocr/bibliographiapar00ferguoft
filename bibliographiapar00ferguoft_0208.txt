description of the 1584 edition. The present, therefore, is
a copy made up of the later issue of the text, with an
earlier title page and preface prefixed. This combination
however has been made long ago, not much later than
1584, I should suppose, from the appearance of the book.
It would be curious to know if any other similarly made up
copies exist.

The present copy (really one of the 1584 edition) con-
tains the following 2-

1. Von natfirlichen dingen, ff. 1-88. There are nominally 10
books, but book 8 is omitted, book 9 is entitled De
cimentis, and book 10, De gradationibus. Mook points
out that this version differs materially from that given by
Huser. Mook, however, has omitted the interesting
entry on f. 88 verso: “Das elfft Buch. De proiectionibus.
Hic deficiebat manus Theophrasti, &c.,’' which occurs
also in the 1572 edition.

2. Manual...vom stein der Weisen, ff. 89-108.

3. Alchymia..‚vom einfachen fewr, ff. 108-129. The second
book is entitled : von den tincturen.

4. De Tinctura Phisica, ff. 129-142.

5. Paracelsisch Buchlein belangend lapidem, fs. 143-148, followed
by the words: Finis libri Metamorphoseos Paracelsicae.
Then comes Bodenstein’s Preface to the Biirgermeister
and Rath of BaseL dated December 2nd, 1571, ff. 148
verso-150.

6. Liber primus de viribus spiritualium, ff. 151-156.

Liber secundus de viribus membrorum interiorum, ff. 156-160.
Liber tertius de confortatione membrorum, ff. 160-166.

Of these tracts Mook says that Nos. 2 and 5 agree with
Hnser's version, Nos. 4 and 6 differ considerably from his,
and No. 3 is wanting in the collected editions„

The 1572 edition of the [Metamorphosis contains only
the first three tracts mentioned above.

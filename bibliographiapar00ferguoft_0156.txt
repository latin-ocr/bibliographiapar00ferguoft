52

There are some interesting and even important notices
in this extract. Pierre Hassard translated the Clzz'rnrgz'a
Magna into French, of which Mook knew only the edition
of 1568 (No. 69). But the allusion to it here confirms the
existence of an earlier edition. Two such are mentioned:
one by Borellius‚ dated 1566, quoted by Mook‚ p. 48, e);
the second by Hauer, de Vigiliis and Adelung, dated 1567,
quoted by Mook‚ p. 51, c). Considering the dates it is
probably the earlier one to which Leo Suavius here refers.
The book de Tartaro may be Mook⁷s No. 32 or 36 (my own
list, No. 51), 1563, while the edition with the Defensz'ones
VII. is undoubtedly that published in 1566, Mook‚ No. 49.
The Liber Paragrammon is, I suppose, the Paragranmn of
1565, Mook‚ No. 46.

The Labyrinthus with the portrait is the edition of 1553,
Mook‚ No. 18. This seems to be the earliest likeness of
Paracelsus, and, judging by the description, it is the one of
which a copy is given in the present work of Leo Suavius‚
p. 81. It was often reproduced afterwards.

The last book mentioned is No. 52 in my list, or No. 39
in Mook's.

This is the passage of Leo Suavius which, apparently
quoted by Marx, has led to Mook’s difficulties and criti-
cism, and has induced me to consider them at length.
Knowing Marx's reference only from Mook's quotation, I do
not feel absolutely certain that Marx after all may not have
meant to refer to this passage, but as he speaks specifically
of Leo Suavius’ catalogus, I still hold to the opinion Ι have
already expressed that Marx meant the Catalogue on p.
85, of which a copy is next given.

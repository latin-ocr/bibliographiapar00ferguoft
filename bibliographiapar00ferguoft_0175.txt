CoPIEs of Paracelsus’ works are not, so far as my experience
goeS‚ becoming any commonet than they were. without delay-
ing, therefore, for the problematical acquisition of more of them,
I have found it desirable to print the description of the few
which Ι have examined or become possessed of since 1890. Ι
am quite aware that it would have been easy to have swelled
the present list by enumerating the copies of Paracelsus' works
in the British Museum. Ι prefer, however, that the account of
the Museum collection, which Ι have kept constantly in view
as forming a substantive part of this investigation‚ should be
contained by itself in one of the numbers of the series, which
I hope will appear before long.

Ι have taken advantage of this opportunity to correct some
previous errors and misprints‚ and to supplement one or two

description s.

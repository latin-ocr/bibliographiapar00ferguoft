part of the little world of man with a corresponding

salse exaggeration of this doctrine, but the idea carried

these, which were not to be found in the bewildering
and untested mixtures of the Galenic prescriptionS. ,
Paracelsus had seen how bodies were purified and in-

and minerals could be made to yield their active principles
it would surely be better to employ these than the crude
and unprepared originals. He had besides arrived by
some kind of intuition at the conclusion that the opera-
tions in the body were of a chemical character, and that
when disordered they were to be put right by counter
operations of the same kind, It may be claimed for
Paracelsus that he embraced within the idea of chemical
action something more than the alchemists did. Whether
or not he believed in the philosopher‘s elixir is of very
little consequence. If he did, he was like the rest of
his age; but he troubled himself very little, isat all,
about it. He did believe in the immediate use for
therapeutics of the salts and other preparations which
his practical skill enabled him to make. Technically he
was not a chemist; he did not concern himself either
with the composition of his compounds or with an ex-
planation of what occurred in their making. If he could

get potent drugs to cure disease he was content, and he

 

worked very hard in an empirica] way to make thern. ,

That he found out some new compounds is certain; but
not one great and marked discovery can be ascribed to

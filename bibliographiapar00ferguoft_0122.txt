In this copy the word Basz'leoe has been obliterated with
an inl< so corrosive that it has burned through the paper.
From the British Museum copy, however,I have got the
name of the place and its correct spelling. On this occasion
Mook (No. 66) was absolutely of no assistance, for he gives
the word as Basil. which could not be correct. Mook’s
title otherwise differs in the most important manner from
the above. He omits the phrase: quornm etiam . . .
indicabit, and substitutes the following: Primo tractatus
metallorum septem. Secundo rernm naturalium tria fore
przbzczpz'a, per demonstrationem artis igneae docetur. Tertio
contractmfarmn orzgz'nes ct curae. Quarto morborum capital-
z'nm qnatnor Epilepsz‘ae, Podczgrae Paratyssz's et Hydropisz's
curae. These are short titles taken from the Snmnmrinm.
The question arises: were there two issues or editions of
this book, one with the title-page as given above, and the
other with what is practically a contents-title‚ as given by
Mook? It is quite possible ; but I have not sufficient con-
fidence in Mook's accuracy to accept the second title
because he has so given it, and further there is strong
proof against it. Mook quotes three copies of this book:
one at Tubingen and one at Munich, the third in the British
Museum‚ I have compared the last with my own copy, and
they agree exactly, even to the errata. The Museum copy
has not the contents-title given by Mook, and this puts
him in an awkward position. If he saw the Museum
copy, how did he not give the title it contains, and draw
attention to the fact that it differs from his version of the
title, which, isit exist at all, must be in one, at least, of
the other two copies. If he did not see the Museum copy,
how did he ascertain its existence ? It could only be from
the catalogue ; and ifhe visited the Museum why did he not
examine this copy? But if he did not visit the Museum‚

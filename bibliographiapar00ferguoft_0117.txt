year of the first letter, and from the misprint M.D. for
M.D.X‘XV. on p. 13, line 24. If it be a misprint‚ the
British Museum copy may be one of a 1566 edition, but in
that case the date of the first letter is aster that of the
second letter. This also is possible, for. although the book
is paged continuously from the beginning, the first letter
may have been written after the second. But if the date
1567 be correct, the second letter was written eleven months
after the first, and the Museum copy belongs to 1567,

But what reason is there for supposing that there is an
edition of 1566 at all? It is reported by Mook (1566,
Bemerkung c)) solely on the authority of Adelung (Gesclcz'clzte

On referring to the passage in Adelung Ι find simply a
list of editions of the De Vita longa, and the statement that
it is contained in Leo Suavius' Compendimn, Paris, 15663
but he gives no further account of it, and I have seen no
other reference to it anywhere. Ι believe that Adelung,
like myself‚ was misled by the date of the first letter into
ascribing the book to 1566, and did not look further in
the book itself for another date.

But Mook's note is of additional interest as showing that
he too was inclined to the year 1566 for the Paris edition,
on the ground of the date of the first letter, though his own
account of the Basel edition of 1568 might have made him
hesitate. For in his remarkably and unusually full colla—

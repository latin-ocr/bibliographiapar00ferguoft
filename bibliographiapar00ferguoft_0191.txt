because on account of Sangelasius’ own distinguished merits
anyone would justly desire to dedicate his work to him as
to a most appreciative judge. He then adds that conceal-
ing himself under the name of Leo Suaviu5‚ like Teucer
under the sevenfold shield‚ he will have no sear of the stings
of censure or rather of sophistical attacks in a new and
difficult subject, if only Sangelasius will play the part to
him of Telamonian Ajax. This would seem to imply that
the book had excited or that Gohory feared that it would
excite hostile criticism, as indeed it was bound to do, and
that he hoped by the influence of Sangelasius to avert it
and the trouble of meeting it as far as possible. This letter
is dated January Ist, 1567, that is 1568. Possibly, there-
fore, this epistle did not form part of the original book,
which indeed is quite complete without it. It may have
been that after a number of copies had been issued, and
the critics were becoming troublesome, he added this
epistle.* In that case the book must have been in circula—
tion before January 1567 (1568).

In connection with the first and second epistles, some
questions arise. As the second epistle is dated eleven

months after the first we may enquire if the volume was

printed as a whole, or if the first division of the volume ι

was printed, say in 1566; if some delay thereupon took
place, and the printing was not proceeded with till the
following year, and if Gohory then found it convenient to

ἦ In the Basil edition he is attacked vigorously, aster the unmealy-
mouthed manner of the time, both by Gerard Dorn and by Peter Perna,
the printer of the book. But as Perna's letter is dated Basil, Ides of
February (13th), 1568, a whole year after the letter to Sangelasius, it
could not have been these criticisms that prompted him to write that

letter.

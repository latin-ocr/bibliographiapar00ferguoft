And so on. But for Dr. Harris having been ‘¹' Physician
in Ordinary to His Majesty‚'’ Charles 11.. and having
“stated things a little calmly,” as became a “physician
of -sense'' rather than a “physician of words,‘’ one might
almost suppose that he had studied in the school of the
man whom he calls “this Cacoplzrastus, or foul-mouth'd
railer.’' Even in our own day, men with a claim to
encyclopaedic knowledge, historic calmness, elegant lan-
guage, as, for instance, Hallam, employ such critical terms
as ‘'audacious but more unworthy innovator‚” “mixture
of fanaticism and imposture,‘’ “paradoxes so absurd and
1nendacious‚’' “ mystical rhapsodies;'' Meryon—“ rhapsody
from a drunken sot,'' “swaggering empiricism‚” ‘⁴ menda-
ciously vaunted his own powers;’' Pereira—“ a vain, igno-
rant, arrogant, drunken quack, sanatio, and impostor. . .

He conferred several important benefits on medicine: he
overturned Galenism, introduced chemical medicines . . .

szfssy (whom Heaven Preserve and Prosper) in so Wise, Faithsul² and Pious
a Counsellor! and how Happy is your Gracc· in serving a prim-e, who Ix'uows
how to value justly the Mmts of a Snbstct never so Great, His Allajesty being
not only in years Superior to all the lx'z'ngs and PJ-z'nces in Europe, but indis-
putably in lVisdom and Capacl'ly. Insomuch that 1 have often heard very
Judicious persons maintain‚ that if His illask’sty had not been Born [sing of
these Realms‚ he would certainly of right have claimed, and justly carried the
Election before all others, who might sor any kind of Merit, have presumed to
appear Competitors. Nor is His Sacred Illajesty only Supream in the Gzfls
and Accomplzklzments of Nature, in his §lupendiozts Prudente in [he Arts of
Goverm'ng, but he is pleased in his Citlz'ersczl Goodnm, particularly to Encour-
age the Prqfessz'on of Plzysz'ck ; and it is well known, and to the llommr os
l'lzysick be it spoken, that His stlaJLu-ty can better judge between a Physician
of [Vm-ds, and a Physisian of sense, between what is Physick in reality, and
what only bears the Ναυιε of it, than perhaps any man of the fizzczcl2211.⁷' From
this the reader can judge what dependence is to be placed on Dr. Harris'
opinion of Paracelsus. It is Curious also to observe how, in the dubious com-
pliment with which the extract concludes, Dr. Han-i>- unwiltingly approaches
Paracelsus' low estimato of the l‘nculty ol‘ hi> lime.

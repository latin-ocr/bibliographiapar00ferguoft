ἓ8. The following supplemental list, which is printed
immediately after Suavius’ dedication to Capella, dated
1567, on p. 159, may be regarded as giving indirect support
to the correctness of the date of that dedication. For it
makes it probable that the list on p. 85 was printed off
before the present titles were obtained, else they would
have been incorporated with the others. Not being so,
there may be thus indicated a break in the printing of the
book between the conclusion of the De Vita Longa on p.
152, and the dedication aforesaid on p. 153, represented by
the dates of the two epistles (see above ξ, 2, No. 126),
during which time the new titles may have come to
Suavius' knowledge. These fragments of evidence all tend
towards confirming 1567, and not 1566, as the date of the
Paris edition.

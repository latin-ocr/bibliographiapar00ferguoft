ENGLISH EDITIONS OF PARACELSUS' WORKS.

§3. In the course of these researches Ι have naturally
taken special note of the English editions of the works of
Paracelsus, and have described them whenever actual copies
have come under my observation. With a few exceptions‚
all the works which, I believe, exist in English, have been
already enumerated in the preceding general lists, but for
convenience ofreference I shall now bring them together and
complete the account osthem by adding the hitherto omitted
titles. After all the total number is not large. When one
considers the prominent place Paracelsus occupied in the
medical world in the sixteenth, and even in the seventeenth
century, the large number of works of which he is the
reputed author, and the multitude of editions of them
which appeared, it is surprising how few of them were
translated into English. There may have been two
causes for this: one, possible dislike to Paracelsus
himself, his doctrines and his advocates; the other a
general distaste the English had, and have even now, to
translations There does not seem to be a sufficient
number of learned men, or sufficient energy and interest
among the unlearned to make translation remunerative in
any shape. In the case of Paracelsus the students were
comparatively few and the labour of translation fell into
the hands of two or three persons. john Hester, John

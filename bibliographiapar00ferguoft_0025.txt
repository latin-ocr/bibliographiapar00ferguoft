‘Christianus Mylius' (No. 49). In the following note

under date 1579 (p. 78), however, the author seems to
have entirely forgotten the note above quoted :

“e) “De cura morbi Gallici Argent. 80 apud Christoph.
Myliu1n.'’ (Athen. Raurz'c. p. 172.) Spacln'us giebt an, es sei
deutsch erschienen (p. 130); ebenso Gesner (Bibl. von 1583):4
‘⁶ Libri ΙΙΙ de cura morbi Gallici Germanice. 8. Argentor. apud
Christianum Molitorum.'⁷ W'ahrscheinlich, dass der Christoph.

Mylius und der Christian Molitor mit unserem deutschen
Christian Miiller identisch sind.”

That is: in 1575 Christian lllsylz'ns is not a Latin resur-
rection of Clarissima Mallem but in 1579 Clzm'stopll. lllylz‘as,
Christian Λῖσίίίον, and Christian Milllcr are probably
identical. To quote Mook's own words, which he applies
to Marx (p. 15, note 55), “Ich kann das nur als lez'clzt-
sinmges Arbeiteu bezeichnen.'’

glo. So many misprints and mistakes in a work
which ought to be scrupulously exact, beget doubts as
to the accuracy of the author’s statements in general,
especially as to the reproduction of the titles of the
books. In the few cases in which I have been able to
compare the title-pages of the books with Mook’s trans-
criptions, I have found only three (the second edition
of the Arclzidoxa, Munich‚ 1 57Ο; Etlz'clle Tractctlein,
Munich‚ 1570; and the 1571 edition of the Vola dem
Bad Pfeffers) approximately coinciding. The others vary
by Mook having omitted some portion of the title, or by
his having altered the spelling. Thus Dorn's Fascz'cvlvs
(No. 135 in Mook's catalogue, 1581) is not given in full,
and certainly not in faesimile of the copy I have had for

It is a small 4to, of 10 preliminary leaves, containing the
title, with an elaborate border, the dedication, a catalogue
of the author’s productioris and the contents, pp. 164 of
text, and 1 leaf of errata.

Among the prophecies are included several taken from
the Prognosticatz'o of ParacelsuS. They will be found in
sections 12, 13, and 16 of the present work.

This can hardly be called a translation of Paracelsu5‚ but
it is the only representation in English of the Prognostz'catz‘o,
that I know. It is not mentioned by Mook.

the Universe opens up two questions—the sources of his
knowledge, and the maintenance of his life in the highest
state of perfection. The former leads to Paracelsus'
distinction between reason and saith, the latter to his
medical system.

In the first he points out that the three parts of man
get this knowledge from three different sources, and by
different faculties. Thus, the spirit gets the knowledge
of the things of time by reason, while the soul gets the
knowledge of Divine things by saith. He therefore objects
altogether to the application of the discursive reason to
the questions of the soul. Both domains must be kept
distinct—they are not contradictory‚ because both are of.

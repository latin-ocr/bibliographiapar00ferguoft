III.

THE FIRST CATALOGUES OF PARACELSUS'
WORKS.

ξ 5. Ι have thought it worth while to reprint certain lists
which if not the earliest are certainly among the earliest
bibliographic summaries of Paracelsus' works, They are
taken from the Compendimn of Leo Suavius‚ about which
I have already had to say so much. In the Paris edition,
1567, they will be found on pp. 15, 84-87, and 159, and in
the Basel reprint of 1568, on pp. 13, 71—74 and 155. So far
as I know they have not been quoted before in any English
work on Paracelsus‚ and though they are mentioned by
Mook he has not given reprints of them. Nor do I know
any work in which they appear except the present one,
and as it is among the rarest of Paracelsian books, it will
certainly never become a common book of reference.
Whether the present reprint be of any use or not, there
will be, at any rate, some interest in seeing what works
were ascribed to ParacelsuS, within twenty-five years of his
death.

§6 In his preface or introduction Leo Suavius gives
first a brief biographical sketch of Paracelsus. discussing
his birth-place, name, ability as a chemist‚ and quoting the
letter from Erasmus. He next speaks of his writings to
the following effect.

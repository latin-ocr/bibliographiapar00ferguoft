thus making it appear that there were two issues of the
same edition. This explanation of the difference was so
plausible that I was inclined to be content with it, until on
more careful examination of the present copy I found that
the Epistle of Leo Suavius to Joannes Capella, pp. 153-158,
was dated at the end : Lutetiae Parisiorum Kal. Iulii Anno
1567. Then, much t'o my chagrin, Ι afterwards ascertained
that the British Museum copy contained this date also, and
that Ι had overlooked it in my former examination of that
copy, as well as in that of the Basel‚ 1568, reprint (No.
60). If this date be correct, it follows that the British
Museum copy cannot have been printed earlier than July
1567, so that it was a mistake to assign the date 1566 to
No. 55. It follows also that a Paris 1566 edition is still to
discover, if such an one exist.

But after this correction is made other questions arise.
What explanation is to be given of the occurrence of the
letter to Sangelasius in certain copies only, and which of
the sets of copies is the earlier? I have found no distinct
answer‚ but certain alternatives suggest themselves as
possible.

There are three epistles by Leo Suavius contained in

this work :—
The first to Renatus Perotus, p. 3, dated ε Lutetiae VIII.

Idus Sext. Anno M.LXVI. (sic).
The second, to Capella, p. 153, dated: Lutetiae Parisi-
orum Kal. Iulii Anno 1567.
The third, to Sangelasius (after p. 376), dated: Lutetiae
Cal. Ianuar. Ann. M.D.LXVII.

As regards these dates, if it be assumed that there
is a 1566 edition as well as one of 1567, then, the year
of the second letter may be a misprint for 1566. That
this is possible is obvious from the misprint in the

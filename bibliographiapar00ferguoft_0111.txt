Small 4to, ff. 128. At the end is the date: M.D. XLIX.
There is no place or printer's name. At the foot of the
title-page is a vignette‚ representing two rnen3 one, to the
right of the reader, has a book; the other, to the left, is
holding up in his left hand a kind of astronomical circle;
both figures are pointing with the right forefinger to the
sun, moon and stars in the sky. In the background are a
town and a castle, and a sheet of water with a swan. In
the upper left hand corner is a head with lines frorn its
mouth, to represent the wind 3 the right hand corner is
filled with clouds. Besides the vignette‚ there are 32
symbolic figures in Paracelsus' tract 3 42 in Liechten-
berger’s, and 14 pictures of sibyls.

Mook (No. 16) describes this book. He writes Pro-
phezez'en, und, Vergangen, Gegenwc'irtzge‚ K it'mzſj‘tz‘ge, and
omits the comma before verkz'lndende. As all the rest
corresponds exactly with the above, Ι have no doubt that
these are alterations of Mook's own. Paracelsus' Prog-
nesticatz'on occupies leaves 2-20. Mook says it is a reprint
of the German edition of 1536, omitting the dedication to
Archduke Ferdinand and the epilogue. The figures are
identical with those in the Latin edition of the same year
(Biblz'ograplcia Paracelszka, Part ΙΙ., 1885, No. 49).

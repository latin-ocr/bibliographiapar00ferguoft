evidence for the evil in one's neighbour‚ one has only
to question one’s own consciousness; but to believe that
a man has in him much good as well as evilv one has not

discovery of facts which would undermine the credibility of
the present authorities, and reverse the judgment of the
last three and a half centuries. That any such exist there
is no reason at present to suppose; and even though there
were, Paracelsus does not fill such a place in the interests
of to-day as that many would know, much less care, that
he was different from what had been generally supposed.
In the meantime the incidents as originally narrated must

might be said ‘is more rarely exercised ³) “than the purely
descriptive. In every narrative are intercalated everywhere
(unconsciously‚ perhaps) incidental comments, passing
judgments are mixed up3 and it is almost impossible to
resist the tendency of the mind to generalize‚ to group

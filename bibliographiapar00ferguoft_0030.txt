2.—1598-1599. [Mook‚ No. 240, among the books without date]
Aurei Velleris. . . . Tractatus ΙΙ. . . . Rorschach am
Bodensee.

This is the second of the five parts of which the
alchemical collection entitled Aureum Vellus consistS. The
first part was published in 1598 ; and, in a note at the end
of the contents‚ it is said that for want of time the second
and third parts were not ready, but would be published
later in the year. As a matter of fact, Part ΙΙΙ. bears at
the end to have been printed in 1599. The fourth and
fifth parts did not appear till some years later—Basel,
1604. Mook is right therefore in saying that Tractatus
II. was printed probably before 1600, but he does not
seem to have seen a complete copy of the collection.
There are several literal errors in his transcription of the
title, and only the part of it referring to Paracelsus is

given.

i11-8³. (1 fl. 12 kr. Seheible.)'' This confirms its existence,
but it is not given by Mook.

341kGraesse quotes an edition of the Archidoxa in Latin by
“ Ad. Schroter: Cras. s, d. in-40. (2 fl. 24 kr. Scheible).''
This edition is not given by Mook in his list of books
without date, but he has apparently assigned it to the year
1569 ou the strength of the date of Schr'oter's dedicatory
epistle (Mook, No. 73).

35.ss—Graesse gives the following ε “ De meteoris liber unus, it. de
matrice, de tribus principiis, et quaedam astron. et astro-
logiae fragmenta. Bas. 5, d. 111-80. ib. 1569. in-SO. (1 fl.
48 kr. Scheible.)'' In a note he adds: “Ses fragments
d'astronomie se re'unissent aussi a son Ltber de praesagiis
etc. Bas. 1569. iii-809⁷ Mook (No. 243) gives the
eslition without date, and on page 62, Belnerkung a),
remarks, on the authority of Gesner, that the book very
likely belongs to 1570. He also gives (No. 72) De prae-
sagiis . . . Fragmenta, Basil, 1569, but says nothing about
the 1569 edition of the “De Meteoris,'’ a copy of which
Graesse seems to have met with 111 Scheible's Catalogue.
Under the year 1575, Bemerkung b), he quotes the “De
Meteoris . . . Basil '⁹ on the authority of Spachius.

&Vliether these works exist or not is a question3 but
since they have been enumerated by a respectable autho-
rity, they should not have been omitted, while others, on
doubtful authority, have been included.

Let us turn to the Catalogue of the Bodleian Library,

the titles from which I shall shorten.

56.Π 1568. Praeparationis ellebori . . . declaratio. Basil, Svo.
This Mook has not seen, as he gives it, 1568, Bemerkung
c), on the authority of Gesner. See above, No. 24.

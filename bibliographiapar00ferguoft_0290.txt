For, according to Paracelsus‚ alchemy, or chemistry‚ is
not the mere art of making, or of perfecting gold, but is
the preparation by fire of all natural materials for use.
Hence he extends the term chemist to the baker, the
cook, the metallurgist—to everyone, in fact, who works
transformation of matter by heat.

The medical system of Paracelsus is that by which he
is best known. One writer has gone the length of saying,
that only the medical parts of his writings, and not the
whole even of these, are genuine, and that the portions
occupied with religious doctrines are interpolated. This

art. Into the minutiae of this part of the subject it is
impossible to enter. A very brief statement of the main
features, and of some of the changes which Paracelsus
made, can only be referred to.

He insisted especially upon the study of natural pheno-
mena; the books of the physician, he maintained, were
Nature's, not Galen’s and Avicenna'S. He twitted the
physicians of the time with their reluctance to put their

and metals. Guided by his theory of quintessence, or
the dominant quality in a thing, he strove to get these
qualitieS, and thus altered to a great extent the form in
which medicines were administered. Instead of giving
mixtures of a dozen or two different bodies, the effects

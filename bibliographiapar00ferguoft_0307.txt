The first collected edition was made by Johann Huser
in German. It was printed at Basel in 1589-91, in eleven
volumes quarto, and is the best of all the editions. Huser
did not employ the early printed copies only, but collected
all the manuscripts which he could procure, and used
them also in forming his text. The only drawback is
that rather than omit anything which Paracelsus may
have composed, he has gone to the opposite extreme
and included writings with which it is pretty certain
Paracelsus had nothing to do. The second collected Ger-
man edition is in four volumes folio, 1603-5. Parallel
with it in 1603 the first collected Latin edition was made
by Palthenius. It is in eleven volumes quarto, and was
completed in 1605. Again, in 1616-18 appeared a re-issue
of the folio German edition of 1603, and finally in 1658
came the Geneva Latin version, in three volumes folio,
edited by Bitiskius.

The works were originally composed in Swiss-German,

takable power. The Latin versions were made or edited
by Adam von Bodenstein, Gerard Dorn, Michael Toxites‚
and Oporinus, about the middle of the 16th century. A
few translations into other languages exist, as of the
Ckz'rzcrgz'a Magna and some other works into French,
and of one or two into Dutch, Italian, and even Arabic.
The translations into English amount to about a dozen,
dating mostly from the middle of the 17th century. The
original editions of Paracelsus' works are getting less and
less common; even the English versions are among the
rarest of their class. Over and above the numerous

editions, there is a bulky literature of an explanatory and

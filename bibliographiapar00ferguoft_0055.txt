places, and has substituted without any system n for v, and
v for u of the original.

As the copyI have had before me wants the last leaf
containing M. T atii ad Germaniam Exhortatio and the
colophon, I arn unable to say whether Mook's transcription
is accurate or not. The colophon which he gives is as
follows :—

Excusant Augustae Vindelicorum, per Henricum Stqner,
XXVI A agusti, An. MDXXXVJ.

This tract was reprinted some forty years later, but with-
out date. Mook, who mentions it (No. 241) says that it
contains the best set of the woodcuts he knows. There
was a copy of it in the Beckford Library (catalogue [1883],
Part iii. No. 409). Mook does not allude to the fact that
it reappeared in the Lectiones of WVolfius, printed in 1600,
and in the quormz'r-Spiegel des weltliclten Bapsts of
Joannes de Hyperiis‚ printed in 1620. These will be
referred to below.

In the British Museum (1395- h. 47) there is a copy of

1

this work the title of which differs both from that above
given and from that of the undated edition (Mook's No.

 

241). It is as follows :—

Prognostica] tio ad vigesimvm qvas] tum vsq3 annum
duratura, per eximium dfim Ι ac Doctorem Paraeelsum,
Ad illustrissimum 1 ac potentissimi] principem Ferdinandum,
Ro-lman. Regem semper Augustum &d Archidu-lc‘em
Austriae &o conscripta. Anno xxxvi. Ι

Marcvs Tativs ad Ι Lectorem. Same as that quoted
above.

Small 4to. Sigs. A-Fiii. Fiv wanting.
This' is probably a mere variation and not a separate

edition.

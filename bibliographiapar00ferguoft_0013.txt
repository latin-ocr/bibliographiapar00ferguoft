IN the “Academy '⁷ for October 20, 1877, No. 285, Volume XH„
p. 387, appeared a short review of Dr. Mook's work, of which
the title-page runs :—“ Theophrastus Paracelsus. Eine Kritische
Studie von Friedrich Mook. . . . ᾗ ⁹⁶ ᾗ Wfirzburg. Verlag der
J, Staudinger’schen Buchhandlung. 1876.⁷' 4to, pp. 136. The
present examination‚ which was completed July 12, 1877, long
prior to the review, contains evidence in detail of the statements
made therein.

Ι have attempted elsewhere (“New College: Glasgow Univer-
sity Album. 1874. Glasgow: James MacLehose. 1874.'’ 8vo,
pp. 261-291) an estimate, in a popular form, of Paracelsus. That
estimate is subject to such change, refutation, or modification as

criticism and discovexy may hereafter necessitate.

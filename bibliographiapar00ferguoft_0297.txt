these two tests with Huser’s edition must decide whether
Huser's edition is to be trusted. (4) If Huser is thus
found trustworthy, the works said by Huser to have
been taken from a MS. of Paracelsus must be held genuine.
(5) Works bearing in form and contents indubitable marks
of Paracelsus' authorship must be considered genuine.
These criteria are doubtless sufficient; they would
certainly require tact and care in their application.
The second section is occupied with a chronological
bibliography of Paracelsus' writings. It contains 276
tides—248 of printed works, and 28 of manuscripts. The
bibliography begins in 1529, in which year was printed
at Augsburg a quarto pamphlet entitled Practz'ca D.
Theophrasti Paracelsz', and goes down to 1845, which saw
the publication at Leipzig of a version of the Nur-nberg
“Figures.'’ To obtain these titles Mook has rummaged
European libraries during twelve years for copies of Para-
celsus' works, and he has succeeded in bringing some
to light which were previously unknown. Whether the
subject deserved such long-sustained effort is matter of
opinion. Fifty years ago, Dr. Robert Watt, no stinter of
labour, said, “To enumerate the immense number of
German treatises (for he understood no other language)
which have been published under his name, would be
bestowing pains upon them which they certainly do not
deserve.’' But in fifty years opinions change, and Dr.
Mook has bestowed the pains. With regard to the ex-
ecution of this, the chief part of the monograph, it has
to my knowledge never been so fully done before. The
amount of information collected by direct personal in-

spection of the books themselves is very great, and there

When the previous part of the review was written I knew
of this translation only by Cooper's and XVatt’s references
to it, and by there being a copy in the Bodleian Catalogue
(Bibliograpliia Paracelsica, 1877, Nos. 17 and 40). Mook
(p. 113, 1659) mentions it on Adelung's authority <V11.p.
361, No. 77). There is a copy in the British Museum. How
has Mook missed it?

is much besides in appended notes about editions which
the author has failed to see, but descriptions of which
he has found in other writers.

Full, however, as this part of the work is, it is not

In the third section‚ in which the tests of authenticity
were to be applied to the works, we are favoured with cer-

work from Paracelsus' MS. Mook, however, fails to

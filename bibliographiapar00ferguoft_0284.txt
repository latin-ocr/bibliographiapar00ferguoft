favour os one or the other. In man, there is, therefore, a
threefold knowledge, the animal, the sidereal-fthat of the

“ ⁷ understanding, and the spiritual. The first two are mortal,

the third, as directly Divine, is not.

The original matter of all things Paracelsus deduces
not from fire, air, earth, and water, but from the salt,
sulphur, and mercury which had been advocated in
the more concrete conceptions of Basil Valentin and
Isaac Hollandus. These primal elements are found
in all matter3 indeed, they form all matter, and by
analysis only these can be got. Without sulphur nothing
grows or blossoms; mercury is the cause of fluidity;
salt gives firmness and strength. Consequently, they
are present in all matter. The principles themselves
cannot be isolated, we see thern only in their efforts,
as in sulphur, which is combustible: mercury‚ which is
volatile3 ash, or salt, which is solid and fixed, and
ncombustible. The body which contains these, properly
mixed, is sound or perfect; if one is in exceSS, it is
sick.

Out of these three elements were developed by the
Divine Spirit the four elements—fire‚ air, earth, and
water. But in the world, besides, were required active
principles, for which the elements furnish the matter3 the
active power must be something different. To this power
Paracelsus gave the name of “Archaeus‚⁷’ the animating
principle, so to speak, of the elements; not a spirit, but
a working force. Thus, while all things are in and out of
the elements, their actions are not due to the elements,
but to their hidden powers—a doctrine at which modern

chemistry has arrived by a very different road, when it

specify the works so described by Huser. (5) Respecting
works passing under Paracelsus' name, the origin of
which cannot be so exactly determined as in the
previous case, and the authorship of which is to be

to the critics of the future. Thus, precisely the place
where directions were most required to prevent the
traveller from going astray has been left without a
finger-post.

To conclude. The title is a misnomer: the monograph
is not a critical study of Paracelsus, but a bibliography
os his works, which the reader may find critical, but
which is imperfect and inaccurate. The inaccuracies are
such that when Mook ascribes errors to other writers, as
he does not unfrequently‚ Mook's mere assertion is not
sufficient evidence that an error has actually been
committed. To make the work the important addition
to medical bibliography which it might be, it would
require thorough revision to remove inaccuracies„ to
complete titles, and to supply deficiencies, and especially
to state what in the author's opinion are really Paracelsus’
works. It is much to be regretted that, after all the
years and labour spent in collecting materials‚ after the
opportunities for comparing editions which the author
has had, we should hardly be a step nearer the know-
ledge of Paracelsus' genuine works—the one thing for
which it was worth while taking the trouble he has
taken, the one thing indispensable, according to the
author himself, for ascertaining what Paracelsus thought,

and thereby of determining what sort of man he was

the back begins an address “ To the Reader.'' The

On the last leaf, “ Well beloued Reader, Ι would here haue
set sorthe diuers & sondry other secretes, but that tyme
would not suffer me, the whiche J meane God willing here-

after to sette forthe to thy great profite & commoditie.''

This account is given by Herbert (Upogz‘aplzical
Antiquilies, London, 1785, I. p. 682). I omitted it
when referring to the book before. Herbert’s account is
repeated as usual by Dibdin (Typograplzz‘cal Antz'qus‘tz'es‚
London, 1819‚vol. 1V.‚ p. 181). Lowndes somehow mentions
only the first part as having been printed in 1580, but
Cooper (Catalogae of Clzenzz'cal Books, 1675, sig. Q4; 566 Bib-
lz'qgrafaphz'a Paracelsz'ca, 1877, No. 12) seems to include both
parts in the title he gives. The copy of an edition printed
by Richard Day, which I described under No. 12, un-
fortunately wants the general title page and the pre-
liminary matter, and though it has the title-page of the
second part, there is no date. Unless, however, it be aucopy
of the edition of 1580, Ι do not know what it can be. At
any rate it was edited by John Hester, and as far 35 it goes
it corresponds exactly with Herbert's collation.

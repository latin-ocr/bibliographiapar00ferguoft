similar cause, probably, is to be ascribed the apparent
indecision of the author about the spelling of certain names
and words. Thus we are favoured with Boerlmave (pp. 14,
15) and Boerltave (in Index of exact Tities already referred
to), Gessner and Gesner, V osii and Vossiz‘, Borellz'ns
repeatedly and Borellus (p. 21, and Index of exact Titles
again). Now that writer himself spells his name Borellins
on the title-page of his “Bibliotheca Clcz'micffl—(not
Cllymiccz as Mook inaccurately reproduces it in the Index
of exact Titles)—-and that, both in the edition of Paris,
M.DC.LIV‚ and in the edition of Heidelberg—(not Haidelberg
as Mook has it in the Index of exact Titles)-—MDCLVI.
Mook seems also unable to make up his mind between
‘¹ unpaginirt '' and “ unpaginiert.''

The following confusion, however, seems still more indica-

tive of carelessness. The note to No. 79, p. 58, runs thus:

“Spachius 1). 34 citirt dieses Buch [Etliche Tractatus . . . .
Strassburg . . . . bey Christian Miiller's Erben. Anno 1570] mit
dem Zusatz : ‘ apud Christianum Myliumff Dies durfte ein Irrthum
sein, 1570 ist Christian Miiller bereits todt und 1575 conf. Nr.
112 begegnen wir Christian Mylius, der wohl keine lateinische
Wiederauferstehung des todten Christian Muller sein soll.
Allerdings finden wir auch im gleichen Jahr wieder einen Christian
Muller3 aber hoffentlich ist derselbe nur ein Sohn des alten
seligen Mtillerff’

So far this is right. Under the year 1575 appear the
names both of ‘ Christianus Mylius ‘ (No. 1 12, No. 116) and
³ Christian Muller‘ (No. 1 19) [‘ Christian Muller' also in 1574,
No. 108, 109]‚ as well as ‘ Mulier’ simply (No. Ι 18), and in
the year 1565 appears ‘Christian Muller’ (No. 45), who

would be the senior according to the above note, and 1566

ciated, and the works having been enumerated, the only
thing remaining sor Mook to do was to apply the criteria
to the works. Let us see his conclusions.

Ι. There being no original manuscripts, the first criterion
cannot be applied. It z's singular, as Mook says, that all
the MSS. which seem to have existed at the end of the
sixteenth century should have entirely disappeared.

2. The works printed in Paracelsus' lifetime are genuine.
These include numbers 1 to 14 in Mook's list, but com-
prehend only 11 separate treatises, of which 5 are medical,
and 6 contain “prognosticati011s.'' Mook claims the credit
—and, justly, so far as I know—of having brought to light
several of these xvriting5‚ the existence of which had been
overlooked by previous writers. He enters into a long
and, it seems to me, irrelevant explanation of the character
of these prognostications, which he thinks were not actual
pmphecies, but rather reflections upon the state of politics
at the time, and attempts to forecast to what future events
they might give rise. He also takes occasion to point out
the futility of Marx's tests, by applying them to these
14 genuine works.

3. According to the third criterion, comparison of Huser‘s
reprints with the genuine works (or with originals) must
decide whether Huser’s statements are trustworthy or
not. This leads to a vindication of Huser from the

suspicions of later critics, Marx and W'olfi by quoting

” Huser's account os the occasion of his making a collected

· edition. This is long, and also to some extent irrelevant;
and, after all, it is only inferentially that one finds out that,
according to Mook's experience, Huser and the originals

agree. Mook says that if we compare the works of

seen with his own eyes, touched with his own hands, and
garnered by the toil of his own mind. There must have
been a striking contrast between the lecture rooms. The
quiet, listlessly-attentive audiences taking down the remarks

utterance to the formulae of diseases, and the prescriptions

looked with detestation on the man who was laying open
their secretS, who was depriving them of their gains, who
was not unfrequently exposing their ignorance. The herald
of the new system in his rostrum, not over well dressed,
nervously active, restless, pouring forth torrents of words
—a strange exposition of dimly seen far-off truths grasped

of nature and her wayS, of which his contemporaries were
profoundly innocent.

who was speaking accordingly, and who not only could
describe but also act. There must have been something

more than mere charlatanerie when Ramus wrote of him—

variations as Strasburg and Strassburg, Ntirnberg and
Nurmberg, and so on. When no place is entered opposite
a full title it means that it is not known. When the name
is within parentheses it means that, though the name does
not appear in the book, it is known or it is almost certain

the name is followed by a query it signifies that it is not

contains it. In this case the number in column 1 or 3 is
preceded by the word in, which denotes that the corre-
sponding treatise will be found in the book, the title of
which in small type, also preceded by the word In, is

the) Principles,’' “ln Archidoxis.'' The practice, however,
has not been quite uniform in this respect, for sometimes
all the editions have been (unnecessarily) repeated—agn,

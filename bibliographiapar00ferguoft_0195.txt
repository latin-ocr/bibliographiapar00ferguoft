Part III. p. 42, l. 8, for “ additions ” read “ Additions”

Part III. p. 46, No. XVIII„ for the date “ 1569 ’' read
“ 1659.'’

Part ΙΙΙ. p. 46, No. XIX„ Archidoxis. In line 13 of the
title, for VIRTUE read VIRTUES.

Part IV. p. 7, No. 150. Ι have queried what Mook says
about the note prefixed to the title page of the Clcz'rurgz'a
Μίνων, because there is no such note in the copy I have
seen, and because the note does appear on the last leaf of
the eleventh volume of the collected works. See No. 153,
Tomus XI. note. It seemS, therefore, either as if he had
made a mistake as to the proper 'position of the leaf, or as
if he had been misled by its having been possibly transposed
so as to appear to belong to the Clcz'rurgicz stlz'nor. In his
transcription of the note Mook has given Palffzem'anz'o

instead of Paltlcenz'ano.

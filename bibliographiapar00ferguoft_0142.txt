by Iohn Charlwood. The following page contains : Faultes
escaped in the Printing. The text is in black letter, all
the rest is in roman.

I quoted this book originally from Will. Cooper (Catalogue
of Clzemz'cal Books, London, 1675, sig. Q4, Bz'blz'ograplzia
Paracelsz'ca, 1877, No. 13). Subsequently I examined the
copy in the British Museum (1174, b. 4 (1))‚ from which I
have taken the present account. The book is briefly
mentioned by Herbert ( T ypograpltical Antiquz'tz‘es, London,
1786, II. p. 1101).

failed to see it in any of the libraries he has visited.
The lists he has more frequently referred to are those of
Adelung, Gesner, and Borellius‚ but that he has not
exhausted this part of the subject is obvious from those
which he has omitted. To quote Lenglet du Fresnoy’s
Catalogue dos Α utcnrs de la Philosophi? Hermotz‘qne, and
Borellius' Bibliotheca, and to omit Graesse's Tre'sor de
Liw'es Raros, tom. V. 4to, Dresden, 1864, is incomprehen-
sible. Not that the list of Paracelsus' works in the Tre'sor
is either complete or satisfactory in its descriptions, but it
approaches perfection when compared with the Bibliotheca
of Borellius, of whom Morhof said long ago: “Sed adeo
is confusus est, ut sibi nunquam visis autoribus, quos e
loll. Baptist. Nemori libro Itche de transnznlatiolze metal-
lica? scripto, qui syllabum illic Chemicorum quorundam
congerit, excerpsit; nonnunquam fictis ἃς mentitis ὲ turba
Philosophorum depromptis, chartas cumulet, adeoque indili-
genter libros consignet, ut somnianti excidisse potius,
quam studio aliquo scriptus liber videatur.''⁵ He has also
omitted Gmelin's enumeration in his Gcsclzz'clztc der Clzcmie,
Manget's list in his Bibliotheca Scriptorum Medicormn,
and, for English translations: “A Catalogue of Chymicall
Books. In Three Parts. . . . Collected by Will. Cooper‚
Bookseller, at the Pclican in Liuio-Britain, London. . . .
Printed in the Year‚ 1675 ;'' Lowndes' Bibliograpllcr's
Mannal, and even Robert Watt’s Bibliotheca Britannica.
It would have been well, also, had he consulted the Cata-
logues of the Libraries which he was unable, or thought it

not worth while, to visit. Had he, for example, referred to

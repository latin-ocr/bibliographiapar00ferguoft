compile sor my own use an alphabetical catalogue of
Paracelsus’ works, with the different editions of each
arranged as far as possible in chronological order. It is
this which Ι have ventured now to print.

52. The list was begun on no defined plan except that
of including all the works jointly and severally which I
knew, a task which seemed simple enough. As Ι pro-
ceeded, however, I encountered certain peculiarities in
the books which forced me to modify the method Ι was
pursuing, and to elaborate the details to a greater extent
than I could have supposed necessary, if the list were
really to be of use. Ι discovered that a distinction must
be made between authenticated and unauthenticated
editions, and between treatises printed by themselves and
in collections along with others that, while the alpha--
betical arrangement by the first principal word of the
title must be followed generally, treatises more familiarly
known by a prominent word or phrase in the title than by
its first word, might be difficult to find, if such word or
phrase also were not given an independent place in the
catalogue.

,ξ 3. All this necessitated cross references of various kinds,
and Ι have not stinted them. Copious as they are, how-
ever, Ι am not sure that even more might not have been
inserted with advantage. The consideration that has
influenced me in this matter has been that Paracelsus
students would prefer finding a title referred to in several
places, or under different headings, to considering under
what word a particular work was likely to be placed,
and perhaps missing it after all. By the cross references
Ι have tried to bring not only the varying titles of one
and the same book together, but also different books on
cognate subjects, so that to the student these cross refer·
ences to some small extent discharge the functions of a
subject catalogue as well.

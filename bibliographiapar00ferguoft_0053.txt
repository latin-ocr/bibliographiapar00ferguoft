THE former part of this Examinatt'on, which was printed in 1877,
completed the criticism of Mook’s study, so far as I myself was
eoncerned, and Ι had no intention, at that time, of ever recurring
again to the subject. As it might have been urged, however,
that I had personally inspected only eleven of Paracelsus' works‚
and that that was too small a number whereon to found a general
and adverse criticism‚ Ι felt bound—when opportunity placed a
larger number of the books at my disposal—to avail myself of
them to confirm my previously expressed opinion. Hence the

appearance of this second part.

crimination of the true from the spurious work-s, which
in Mook’s own judgxnent 15 1116 gist of the whole question,
should not have become practically a whit easier or more
satisfactory than it was before.

ἓ 16. To sum up. The Title is a misnomer. The
monograph is not a critical study of Paracelsus3 it 15 a
bibliographic study of his works‚ to which some might
possibly deny the epithet “critical’' XVhatever it meant
to do, it hardly gives a criticism of the editions, certainly
not a critical estimate of the works, or of Paracelsus either
as a man, physician, chemist, or author. It is incomplete
in numbers; incomplete in descriptions3 it contains many
typographical errors. If Marx and Haeser have sinned
against the canons 01 textual criticisrn, Mook has broken
the laws 01 bibliography, in that he has not given the 111165
01 many 011116 books complete. Mook's work is not so
accurate and unprejudiced, as that, when he affirms another
writer to be probably in error, that writer is to be believed
in error, on his authority solely. 'Were I engaged in the
study of Paracelsus' work-s, I should use this catalogue,
but where Mook differed from others, I should have no
confidence in the former being certainly right, and the
latter wrong. The book as regards its main purpose is
a failure, but it must in fairness be acknowledged that the
amount 01 information about Paracelsus’ works‚ gathered
by direct personal inspection, is extraordinarily great, and
if it were only as reliable as it is elaborate, the book would
form one of the most valuable 01 recent additions to rnedi-
cal and chemical bibliography. What it requires is a
thorough revision to remove inaccuracies and fill up de-

fects, and one’s opinion of 1116 author would certainly 1156

PREFATORY NOTE.

In this investigation I originally engaged with some
degree of interest, inasmuch as Mook seemed to me to be
criticising the errors of others with a severity, which could
hardly have been excused had his own work been
immaculate, but was quite indefensible when it proved
on examination to abound in the very errors and defects
he was complaining of. The previous parts were
accordingly occupied with an enumeration of blemishes
apparent in Mook’s work, and with certain general con-
clusions deduced therefrom as to its bibliographic value.*
Attention enough having been bestowed in the meantime
on these matters Ι have turned to topics which suggested
themselves to me during the earlier stages of this research
as not having been taken up by Mook, and relating to
which I collected material as I went along. Ι have
considered that it may not be out of place in continuation

and extension of what I have already printed to add this

ἦ When, in 188 5, the second and more detailed part was printed,
I was not aware that Mook was no longer alive, otherwise one or two
phrases, which Ι believed I was addressing to a still living author,
might have been modified.

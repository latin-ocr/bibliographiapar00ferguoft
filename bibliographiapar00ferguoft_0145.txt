This is a reprint of the work which appeared in 1575,
1580, and 1596, and which has been already referred to
(Bz'bliogmpln'a Paracclsz'ca, 1877, No. 12). It was unknown
to Mook.

translation of the “ De Mineralibus‚ s. de generatione
Metallorum et Mineralium und de mysteriis naturae,

the statement is correct or not. Ι have not met with such
a book, though it quite possibly exists. What seems to
come nearest to it is the 1657 edition of the ‘⁴ Chymical
transmutation and generation of Metals and Minerals.⁷’

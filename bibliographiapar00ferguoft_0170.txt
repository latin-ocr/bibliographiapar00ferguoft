This, therefore, is the explanation of his having missed
so much in the British Museutn 3 he does not seem to have
had the capacity to make sure that he had examined
everything. It is not that he never was in the Museum, as
Ι have been led to think, and even to say more than once,
but he simply did not exhaust the material that was avail-
able for his purpose. At first Ι was at a loss to comprehend
how he could have visited the Museum, gone over the
catalogues, and yet either not observe or not examine
English and other editions which are in it, and of which he
has taken no notice, as for instance, the very edition of
Leo Suavius' compendium, Paris, 1567, for a copy of which
he had been on the outlook3 but the explanation has
become obvious from what is said by the authors Ι am
speaking of.

Further insight into Mook's life and training, character
and work may be got incidentally from the Paracelsus-
Forsclzmlgen, and as a result I have been led to modify my
views regarding the cause of Mook’s errors and omissions
as I have already stated in g 1 of the present part.

Ι hope hereafter to give a more detailed notice of these
valuable contributions to Paracelsian literatures

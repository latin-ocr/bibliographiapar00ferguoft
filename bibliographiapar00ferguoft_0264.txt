belonged George Bombast von Hohenheim, Grand Master
of the Order of St. John. His father lived for a time at
Maria-Einsiedeln, in the Canton of SchwyZ, and it was
there that Paracelsus was born in or about the year 1493.
Two houses, one of which was demolished even during the
present century, formerly claimed the distinction of being
the spot where he first saw daylight. There is another
account, however, which is put forward in opposition to the
preceding, but which is not quite so flattering to Paracelsus.
According to this, his father came from Gais, in Appenzell,
and his name was not Hohenheim, but Hohener, or
Hochener. It is hardly necessary to enter here into the
proofs of these accounts. The older writers1 incline to
believe with Erastus that he belonged to the lower strata
of society3 while more recent and less biassed authorities
say that he was certainly a Hohenheim, and that all other
accounts are false. Some go the length of exhibiting the
arms of the family3 but others assert that heralds regard
with sinister aspect certainly the shield of Paracelsus'
father, and probably his own as well. Respecting his
mother, it is only said that she was the superior or
superintendent of a lazaretto at Einsiedeln when VVilliam
von Hohenheim married her.

When Paracelsus was nine years old, his father removed
with his family to Villach in Carinthia. There he resided

¹ Le Clerc‚ however, supports the nobler extraction of Paracelsus,
and says that Erastus does not seem to have taken the trouble to
ascertain the true state of the case. It is singular that, while follow-
ing Erastus in other matters, it did not occur to him that Erastus
might be as inaccurate in them—Histoire de la Mc'ddcz'ne, p. 793,
Arnsterdam, 1723.

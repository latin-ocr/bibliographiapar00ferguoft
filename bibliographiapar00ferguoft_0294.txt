others. And though in a hundred, or a hundred and fifty,
years later, the Paracelsian elements were attacked and
controverted, men never returned to the Galenic medicine.
Paracelsus had conquered. Hz's was tjae kingdom.

In glancing over his writings, one is struck especially
with one thing—the entire originality of the whole.
There are no quotations from other writers, more especially
from the classics. He had evidently thought out his own
system, and, right or wrong, he stands or falls by it.
His works have all the marks of a powerfully originative
mind; in one sense they are worthy of that nature for
which Paracelsus in his philosophy gave up no little.
They are wide, many-sided ; they seem indifferent whether
they are accepted or rejected.

But, however cosmogonic in its range, it was faulty in
its foundations and superstructure. The facts and theories
of metaphysics and morals he started from, not as
already proved, but because they were to him sels-evident,
and to question them would have been almost impious.

The physical part of his cosmogony is evidently
based on the Scriptural account of the Creation‚ but
interwoven with such an amount of physical facts as
had been attained by theorizing up to his time, filtered,
besides, through mystical theology and cabalism. It may
be viewed, therefore, as an attempt to state his observa-
tions on the world in such a way as, not perhaps to
explain the origin of all things, but to place them in
such lights that, by reflection from them, places dai-k
and sombre in life and action may be illumined and
made available for future progress‚ and utilized in the

form of a more perfect medicine.

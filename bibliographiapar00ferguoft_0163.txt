the title-page of it, the last figure of the date 1656, as
printed, has a pen stroke drawn through it, and written
beside it in ink, in a contemporary hand, is the date:
“December 5, 1655.'' These alterations apparently mean
that although the book is dated 1656, it was in reality
published before the end of 1655 3 in other words, that the
custom of post-dating a book printed towards the end of
a year is an old one. Seeing this correction Mook may
have adopted it as giving the true date, but, if so, he should
have added what Ι have now stated.

Against this explanation, however, is the fact that a
similar alteration appears in the Museum copy of Tlcree
exact pz'eces of . . . Plcioravant, on the title-page of which
there is written, apparently in the same hand : “ Octob. Ist
1651,’' with a pen-stroke drawn through the last figure of
the printed date 1652. Mook‚ however, has not taken any
notice of this alteration, but gives the date as 1652 (No.
214). But from what we know now of Mook's way of
working, it is quite possible that he may have examined
the one volume, and never have thought of looking at the
other, so that he would miss the written date in it
altogether.

From these dates, however, being altered in manuscript,
the conclusion seems to be almost inevitable, that there are

no editions of these two books having respectively the dates
1655 and 1651 printed on the title-page.

The copy of this tract from which I took the description
given in Bz‘blz'ograplzia Paracelsica, Part 11„ 1885, No. 49,
wanted the last leaf, containing verses and the colophon, so
that I was unable to say whether Mook had reproduced
them accurately or not. Ι have since got another perfect

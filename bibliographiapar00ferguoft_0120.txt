There can be no doubt that on this occasion at all
events Mook was wrong in his criticism of Marx. It is
remarkable that it did not occur to him how improbable it
was that Gohory, whose works appeared at Paris and
Orleans, should have printed this one first at Basel.

But while Marx was right in the date of the edition he
used, he may have made a mistake in the number of the
page. On page 15 of the 1567 edition, quoted by MarX,
there is an enumeration of Paracelsus‘ works, taken from
Petrus Hassardus‚ but the catalogue of the works by Leo
Suavius, to which Marx seems to refer, is to be found not
on p. 15, but on p. 85, and I have reprinted both of these
in §g 6, 7, below. Now if Marx has here made a slip, it can
be explained and may be excused. It may be a misprint 3
or he may have fallen into some confusion about those two
enumerations; or he may have misread the number 85,
which he might easily have done, for it is small and rather
blurred, and anyone heedlessly or hurriedly might take it
for 15. This however is not the blunder of which Mook
accuses him, for, in the Basel edition of 1568, the lists
appear on pages 13 and 72 respecthzely, and the figures
are so clear as to preclude the possibility of a mistake.
Marx's real error lay in quoting an edition that Mook did
not know.

With the present copy the history of the book becomes
more complete. It first appeared at Paris, but Ι am very
doubtful if it was in 1566. Then came the two issues of
1567, but which was the earlier Ι am unable to say. The
book was next reprinted at Basel (Bz'blz'ograplzz'a Paracelsz'ca,
Part II. 1885, No. 60). The portrait of Paracelsus was
omitted, and there were added an Apologia by Dorn, and
a letter from Perna, the printer‚ to Gohory, dated:
Basileae, Idus Februarii, MDLXVHI.

Long ago (Bz'blz'ograplcz'cz Paracelsm, 1877, p. 16) I pointed
out that it was difficult to be sure when &a occurred in one
of Mook's titles whether it belonged to the title originally,
or was used by him to indicate portions which he found it
convenient to omit. In several of the following numbers
examples will be given, but the present title is specially
interesting. For it so happens that the original title (like
No, 123) does itself contain the contractiori ἔπι, yet Mook
has used it also for the phrases he has left out, without
considering the bibliographical confusion in which he was
involving his version. For as far as he tells us all three
&ch might be in the original title, or all three might have
been inserted by Mook himself.

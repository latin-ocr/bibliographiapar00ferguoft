potent mineral medicines, and of those which had been
previously employed he extended the knowledge and
value.

In this he was violently opposed both by the physicians
and apothecaries. His drugs were despised, he himself

was under these circumstances that Paracelsus crowed
defiance to all the schools of the time. “All of you are
after me; Ishall be the monarch; mine will be the

Then, as he seems to have done with his own special
ideas, he enlarges their comprehension‚ and thus Tartar
becomes the origin of all disease which is attended with

unchecked. Continued consideration, however, supple-
mented by facts about Mook personally which have only
recently come to my knowledge, has led me to the different
conclusion that there was some peculiarity about Mook
which prevented him observing with sufficient attention to
detail, or recording what he observed with sufficient precision3
that, with a genuine desire and a strenuous effort to make a
complete and reliable catalogue of Paracelsus' books from
the books themselves, he was somehow without the capacity
for carrying out his plan thoroughly. Ι have consequently
ceased to attach significance to Mook’s variations, to care
to criticise them, to hold him altogether responsible for
them, or to feel more than curiosity as to their extent.
About their existence in a given case there need hardly be
a doubt, for Ι believe now that the normal condition of a
title as given by him is to be inaccurate, or incomplete, or
both, and that should one happen to be correct, or nearly
so, it is by accident, and not by any care on his part.

That this peculiarity of mind should have exercised such
an influence is much to be regretted, for it has deprived
Mook's work of the one important quality, accuracy.

Nothing more, however, can now be made of it, and
Mook's catalogue, if it cannot be relied on for exact biblio-
graphic comparison, is still, and will likely continue to be,
indispensable as a reference list, besides being, as I have
formerly remarked, the fullest that has been published up
to the present time.

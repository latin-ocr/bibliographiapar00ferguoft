He himself, however, valued his method and his know-
ledge very differently, and argued that he knew what his
predecessors were ignorant of, because he had been taught
in no human school. “Whence have I all my secrets,
out of what writers and authors? Ask rather how the

ority to his contemporaries. So in 1526 or 1527, on his
return to Basel, he was appointed town physician, and
shortly afterwards he gave a course of lectures on medicine

in Latin; they were expositions of his own experience,
of his own views, of his own methods of curing, adapted
to the diseases that afflicted the Germans in the year

who followed them and disputed about them in 1527.

for which the regular physicians could do nothing. For

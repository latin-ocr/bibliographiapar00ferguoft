This account is also given by Herbert (Typograplzz'cal
Antz'quz‘tz'es, London‚ 1790, III. pp. 1717, 1718). The book
has no date, but according to Herbert’s note about Sir
Walter Raleigh it cannot be later than 1584; it is therefore
the earliest edition of the collection, that of 1596 being pro-
bably the second. It is to the 1596 edition Herbert refers
in his direction : “ See p. 1290.'' There is no copy of this
undated edition in the British Museum, but according to
the catalogue, there is a copy in the Bodleian, which Ι
could just quote in Part 1„ 1877, No. 42.

I have quite recently examined this copy, the description
of which is as follows :—

the facts so as to make an effective story, or a striking
picture.'' Keeping this in remembrame, the cautious reader
will accept with due qualification the statements of one
or two witnesses only, and particularly when, unfavourable,
they come from enemies. Eamus, Conring, Oporinus, and
others, who made so fierce an onslaught upon Paracelsus
and his system and followers, may be—indeed must be—
believed as to certain facts bearing upon his life and
manners; but all of them show so much virulence in
their several accounts, that one is doubtful about the
extent to which they may be trusted.

At this distance of time, when all immediate personal
concern in the people and their disputes has disappeared, it
is remarkable how, with a slight interpretation, which Para-
celsus' contemporaries either could not or would not allow,
some of his so-called sels-assertion and vulgarity is found
to be intelligible and even endurable. By such favourable
explanations his more recent biographers have, to a certain
extent, modified previous opinion, and given him that
position in the history of science to which he seems fairly
entitled. Nevertheless, one feels that a critical and im-
partial life of Paracelsus has still to be written; and after
acknowledging what has been already done, and making
allowance for the limited interest which the subject
presents‚ one confesses that the surprise expressed by
Brucker one hundred and fifty years ago is not without
foundation still.

The details of Paracelsus' life are both meagre and

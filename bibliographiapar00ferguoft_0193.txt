now a description of the book, which can be substituted for
that of Herbert, as it exhibits the arrangement of the title-
pages and supplies a more detailed collation. Herbert’s
transcript is almost perfect, but he omits the duplication of
‘⁸ ex ” in the fourth line of the title; writes “mineralles”
without the capital; “ English” for “ Englishe''; “shop’'
for “Shop’'; “Ende” for “ende'' In the note at the
very end of the book Herbert writes “profite ἃ corn-
moditie’‘ for “profite and commoditie.'' In rny original
quotation of the title of the second part of the Key (Biblio-
graphia Paracelsica 1877, No· 12, p. 29) ‘⁴ preparyng'' ought
to have been printed “preparying’'‚ as it stands in the

original, and as is given in the transcript below.

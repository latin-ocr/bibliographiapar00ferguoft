Mook (No. 222) quotes the title from 3 copy in the
British Museurn. With the exception of 3 couple of mis-
prints‚ his version agrees with the above up to the words
“sold by‚·’ after which it runs “Samuel Thomson at the
Bishops Head in Pauls Church-yard,” with the date 1661.
Will. Coopcr likewise gives the date of it as 1661 ; but, at
a recent sale of works on the occult sciences in London,
there was 3 copy of this 1660 edition. 1113116, therefore,
little doubt that there are at least two editions of 11115
VVork, if, indeed, there be not three. For, in a list os
‘⁸ Books sold by william Cooper” contained in “Collectallca
Cleymz'ca: a Collection of Ten Several Treatiscs in Chym-
istry, London, 1684,'' 8vo, there occurs “Paracelsus his
Archidoxis, 1663, 8vo.“ The catalogue of the Bodleian
does not contain any. wau, LowndeS‚a1]d Graesse seem

to have made 3 mistake in the title. See below, No. 45.

affirms that the character of a compound depends, not
merely on what elements, but in what form they are present.
Not that it would be correct to view this as an anticipation
of the modern deduction from certain experiments, the
existence of which in the time of Paracelsus was, so far
as we know, impossible-but the analogy shows persist-
ence and revival, ever and anon, of certain ideas relative
to the constitution of matter, so that we might venture
on a different conclusion, and say that the modern idea
may have been based less on the experiments than its
author supposed. By this reasoning it was simple to show
that the qualities of all matter were but so many expres-
sions of the lise it contained. Over each of the elements,
whether primal or secondary, there was a force, a spiritual
principle, which was setting it ever in motion to fulfil its
nature. Every part of nature has, therefore, a life of its
own, derived from a spiritual source. The body which
exhibits it may be destroyed, but not the spirit itself.
When the two separate, the spirit returns to the original
chaos or limbus.

It would be absurd to try to identify this with any
modern doctrine of physical philosophy; it is rather the
ever repeated recoil of the mind upon itself for an ex-
planation of what is driven in upon it by the senses,
when it gets back to first principles, to a “universal
yea'’—and the result of which is expressed in one age
by spirit, and stars, and chaos, and Creation‚ and in
another by matter, and gravsty, and vortices. Now, as
in the time of Aristophanes, Δῖνος βασιλεύει, Whirl
reigns, and Zeus is for the moment in disgrace; but in

the mind of Paracelsus there was no endowing matter

regarded in the meantime as doubtfu13 some may exist 3
others almost certainly do not.

3⁵. The third column, headed “ Bibl. Para.'’, contains the running
numbers of my own lists. The numbers contained in the
different parts are as follows :-—

Part Ι. 1877. Nos. 1-48.

Part II. 1885. Nos. 49-121.

Part III. 1890. Nos. 122-146.

Part IV. 1892. Nos. 147-161.

Part V. 1893. No. 162. [See below, ξ 9.]

When Part Ι. was printed, Ι had seen only Nos. 1-11,
and Nos. 12-48 were quoted from other writers, especially
(}raesse.³⁵ These, therefore, must be considered as un-
authenticated, except in so far as copies of some of them
have come into my hands and have been described in my
subsequent lists, but of Nos. 1-11 and Nos. 49-162 the
descriptions have been taken from actual copies.

4⁰. The fourth column contains the titles of the books and tracts‚
and these have been made as brief as possible, consistent
with their identification. In these transcripts no regular
attempt has been made to preserve the peculiarities of
spelling, punctuation, and typography of the original, but
whenever I have been in doubt about Mook’s titles and
have not been able to check them by reference to the
books themselves, Ι have reproduced his version un-
changed. Some of his titles seem to me to be inaccurate,
but it is possible that they stand in the original as he gives
them; anyhow Ι have refrained from altering them. A
small Roman numeral in column 3, or prefixed to a title in
column 4, refers to the list of English translations ⁴con—
tained in Bibliograplzicz Fam-elsua, 1890, Part ΙΙΙ, ἓ 4.

5⁰. The fifth column contains the place of printing or publication.
The names are spelt as they occur in the books or in
Mook’s transcriptions as the case may be, and hence such

*1 can see now that the quoted works (Nos. 12-48) should not have been
included in my running numbers, but I did not anticipante in 1877 the continuance
of this investigation to which I seem committed.

these four—(1) want of accuracy; (2) want of systematic

description; (3) omission of authorities; (4l incomplete-
ness.

§4 (Ι) VVant of Accaracy. To the misprints formerly
enumerated (Bz'blz'ogmpllia Paracelsica, 1877, go) might be
added others, thus: p. 13, Petrus Ramams for Petrus Ramns ,·
p. 39, Leo S. Lnavius for Leo Snavins‚’ p.41‚ Bemerkung,
Bertlzoneae for Bertlzemzeae,· p. 46, No. 148 for No. 136;
p. 104, No. 199 for No. 196. Again z on p. 3 Mook quotes
“Meiners‚ III. Β. p. 345‚'' but without either naming the
book or inserting this author in his so-called index of
‘⁴ exact titles‚'' and, similarly, on p. 15, “ Bmcker, Pars. IV
p. 646 solg.‚'’ without saying which of the two treatises
under Brucker's name in the same index he intends to be
consulted.

But the titles themselves are more than sufficient evidence
of the general inaccuracy of Mook’s work. If the preced-
ing list be analysed it will be found that there are only two
or three titles which, as given by Mook‚ are quite free from
typographical and other variations. I do not now allude to
the omissions and alterations which occur, but to mere dif-
ferences of spelling and punctuation which are constantly
to be met with in Mook’s transcriptions. However‚ all
that can be said against Mook on this score has been
summed up by himself (No. 125, see No. 70 above) in
the spelling of the one superlative word, acnratz'ssz‘mi.

Further proof of Mook's inaccuracy is superfluous.

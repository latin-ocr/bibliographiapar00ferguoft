in the date. In the previous description I specially
directed attention to the fact that the volume was
dated 1591, although volumes VIII. and X. were
both dated 1590. The second copy, however, is
dated 1590.

This peCuliarity has been alluded to by Drs.
Schubert and Sudhoffffi in connection with a dispute
between two German historialis, Dr. Rohlfs and
Dr. Proksch, one of whom asserts that the date is
1590, the other that the date is 1591. They show
by comparison of copies contained in several
libraries (to which may now be added the present
copy) that both dates are found, and not only so,
but that volume X. has sometimes the date 1590,
like both of my copies, sometimes 1591. So that
both these historians are right in what they affirm,
and are wrong in what they deny, and their dispute
is a further striking illustration of the danger of

, over-confident opinion and assertion in biblio—
graphical questions.
85.—Volume X. The second copy corresponds with
the description, so far as that goes. A folding
table, however, at p. 68, should have been men-
tioned. It is contained in both copies. At the
end of the Appendix to this volume, the second
copy has one leaf, not paged, containing a Frag-
mentvm Astrmlomz'cwn et Magz'cvm, supplemental to
p. 491 of volume X. This leaf has been removed
from the other copy.

86.—1596. A hundred and foureteene Experiments and Cures.
London, 1596.
Small 4to. Preliminary matter, ff. [8]3 Text, pp. 82.

Of this collection I have recently inspected other two
copies, both of which agree with that described under No. 86.

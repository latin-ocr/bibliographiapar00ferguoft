authority, that rather than believe Galen their master,
or Avicenna, his commentator, mistaken in any fact, im-
portant or unimportant‚ they would affirm that nature
had changed, or that themselves had observed amiss.
Paracelsus was incapacitated by nature for such saith
as the medical schools required of its graduates. Rather
than comply with such a request, he preferred rejecting
even the truth which it may have contained, and came
out with the startling statement that every country and
every age produces its own physician. Just as in nature
the poisonous plant and the antidote are often found
growing side by side, so the genius of a people produces a
physician suited for its own peculiar diseases: Galen for
the Pergamenians, Hippocrates for the Greeks, Avicenna
for the Arabs, Paracelsus for the Germans. In Paracelsus’
view, however, the genius of the people went much farther,
demanding a new medical theory, and a new treatment
of disease founded upon the new theory and wider ex-
perience. With these demands it was Paracelsus’ aim
to comply, and it is from his multiplicity of aims‚ and
the way he tried to compass them, that he slips through
the grasp of the expositor or critic. Fully to estimate
his ideas—and however useless they may be, they cannot
be ignored—one must be skilled, not only in philosophy
and theology, not only in mysticism or magic, or any
vagary of the kind in which the human mind indulges,
but one must be a physician, a surgeon, a physiologist
a pharmacist. Hence the difficulty of meeting with a
fair estimate of the man, or of forming one which shall
not be tinged with one's favourite hypothesis, or bear

signs of the topic in which one feels greatest interest.

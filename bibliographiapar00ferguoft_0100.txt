of Basz'lcae. This may be nothing else than a misprint, but,
whether or not, Mook has shown by his noticing it that he
was sufficiently alive to such minute differences. It is
impossible, therefore, that he could be unaware of the
changes that he himself has made in the course of his
transcriptions.

One of the most notable irregularities is to be found in
Mook's treatment of dates Sometimes the date is given
along with the title, but it is oftener omitted, and it is diffi—
cult to see what has been the guiding principle in either one

his difficulties begin. It is unnecessary to give instances;
the following may suffice. It is to be found on p. 64,

only 3 chronogram is described as “s. a.‚'' although it has

found its way into 1116 correct year. On the other hand,

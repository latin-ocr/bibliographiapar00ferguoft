prefix a new epistle to the Scholia themselves. If all that
were not so, and the whole volume were printed in 1567
consecutively without any delay, it is noteworthy that
Gohory should have retained at the very beginning a
dedication that was eleven months old, and that had been
followed by another to a different person.

The book therefore contains certain anomalies difficult
to reconcile‚ and presents certain alternatives between
which it is difficult to decide. In any case the conclusion
seems to be that the book must have appeared subsequeut
to July 1567, and prior to the date of the Basil reprint
(No. 60, Mook No. 62), the earliest possible date of which
is February 13th‚ 1568 (1569).

These are described under Nos, XV. and XX. of the
English list, but they ought to have appeared in the
general enumeration as well.

Biblz'ogmplzia Paracelsz'ca (1877, No. 12) contained a notice
of an imperfect copy of the sz of philosophie, which Ι in—
ferred was of the edition of 1580. Subsequently‚ under
No. 111. of the list of English editions contained in
Part ΙΙΙ., I quoted Herbert's account of the 1580 edition,
and as my imperfect copy corresponded so far exactly
with that account, I considered my inference as to its date
to have been confirmed. I have recently acquired another
copy of the 1580 edition, which, while supplying the
portions the other copy lacks, shows by their identity

otherwise that the two belong to the same edition. Ι give

his death was the result, they said, of a fit of dissipation
which lasted several days, and when he was at last
found, it was on the floor of a mean tavern, from which
his boon companions had fled. A more authentic account,
however, is that he died in the hospital of St. Stephen‚
in Salzburg. What the cause of his illness was, it is not
easy to say. Some of his biographers tell us that the

steep place, and did not survive the injuries he received.
An examination of his skull in the early part of this
century showed a flaw, which there is no reason to doubt
resulted from some injury when Paracelsus was still alive.1
He was buried in the churchyard of St. Sebastiam his
remains were afterwards removed to another part of the
same cemetery, and his monument is still to be seen. A
pyramid of white marble‚ with his likeness sunk into one
side, and over it the well-known inscription, in which
he is described as the curer of incurable sores.

If the life of Paracelsus is imperfect and obscure, still

his lifetime a few treatises on various parts of medicine,
has given his name to a collection of writings which, in

some editions, fiils three folio volumes, and in another

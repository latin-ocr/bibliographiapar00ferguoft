his philosophy and his experience did not agree with
one another. It was doubtless a very great ideal of
medicine which Paracelsus raised; but when it came to
realizing it in every-day life he could hardly do else
than fail. During the three hundred years which have
elapsed since his time knowledge both of the macrocosm

Some of his doctrines have been already alluded to in

1. Mook’s catalogue contains most of Paracelsus' works
and editions. It is the most nearly complete that has ap-
peared, though a considerable number have been overlooked
by him.

2. It is quite possible to identify a copy of any of
Paracelsus' works by Mook's description of it.

3. Though the list is nearly complete in numbers, it is im-
perfect and quite unreliable in its bibliographic descriptions‚
and it is devoid of numerical data for the comparison of
copies.

We hear much of the characteristics of German research
——its minuteness‚ its exhaustiveness‚ its accuracy. Mook
does not think the work of Marx and Haeser distinguished
by these qualities, and Mook's own work has been proved
to be distinguished by their absence. Is, then, the work of
Mook and his predecessors typical of that German devotion,
thoroughness, and patience, which we are told we ought
to copy as closely as possible? In my opinion, the only
use that can be made of such a model as the work of
Mook is to avoid it.

If in future I find anything more to say about Paracelsus

and his books, it will be apart from special criticism of
the so-called “ Critical Study’' of Dr. Friedrich Mook.

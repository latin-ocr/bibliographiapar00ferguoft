in addition to these titles, which are given at first hand,
there are numerous notes upon works and editions which
have been reported from other writers, but which Mook
has not himself seen, and upon those, the dates and
titles of which seem to be given incorrectly by biblio-
graphers. The list is arranged in four divisions, chrono-
logically, and with a running number. The four divisions
consist of: Ist‚ works published during Paracelsus' life-
time; 2nd, works published after Paracelsus' death, the
date being given; 3rd‚ works with no date3 4th‚ manu-
script copies of Paracelsus' works. It would have increased
the value and facilitated the use of this catalogue, had
there been an alphabetical list of the separate toeatises, with
references to the editions published in different years. This
list might have been made quite short; but it would
have been very handy to enable one to ascertain what
editions and how many there are of any particular treatise.

brief. It will be noticed more minutely below.

§8 If it were worth while to spend a dozen years
over the bibliography of any man’s works at all, and
especially over those of Paracelsus, the qualities that one
might expect to find in the published results would be
accuracy systematic and uniform description, quotation
of all authorities that would throw light on the subject, and
completeness. I consider Mook's work defective in all
these qualities

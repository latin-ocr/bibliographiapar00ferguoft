indefinitely the printing of this Part. Resides, though such
an addition might be useful for critical or editorial pur-
poses, it would not be so specially for bibliography. If
such an index were to be made it would be simplest
to confine it to a comparison of the editions of the
collected works with each other in an appendix devoted to
that purpose alone.

59. Since finishing Part IV. a year ago, I have been
able to add only one new title to my list, that of the
Metamorphosis of 1574. It is as follows :—

162.—1574. (1584.) Metamorphosis Theophrasti Paracelsi‚
Dessen werck seinen meister loben wirt. Was nun darin
tractirt wirt‚ wirt volgends blat nach der prefation anzeigen.
Durch D. Adamen von Bodenstein mit besten fleiss, sich zu
commendieren dem hochwurdigen seinem Gn. Fiirsten
vnd herrn, herrn Melchior, Bischoff zu Basel, in druck
gegeben. M. D. LXX iiij. Ανὲχου καὶ ἀπέχου.

Small 8vo. Signatures: ):( in eight (?), a to x in eights,
or ff. [6] 166. Tine, Bodenstein’s preface or letter to
Melchior, Bishop of Basel, dated: Basel, August, 16th,
1574, and Innhalt, ff. [6]. Text, ff. 1—166. The last
two leaves of ):( and of x are wanting in this copy. There
is no place or printer's name. It is not such a striking
book as the 1572 edition described under No. 133.

Mook (No. 105) omits the sentence ἶνας nun anzeigen,
the commas after Melchz'or and BaseL and the date. Com-
paring the above with Mook's description, there seems to
be no preliminary matter except Bodenstein's preface or
letter, so that the two wanting leaves ):( 7 and 8 are
probably blank. On further comparison‚ however, it
appears that the rest of the book does not tally with
Mook‘s account of the 1574 edition. The latter is only
partially paged, and has the imprint of Samuel Apiarius
for Peter Perna, whereas the above copy is foliated all
through and has no imprint, but corresponds with Mook’s

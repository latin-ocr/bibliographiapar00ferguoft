comparison. similarly, the title-page of Bitiskius' collected
edition, published at Geneva in 1658, is very much curtailed,
and what is given is not exact in minute points. As Mook’s
transcriptions‚ therefore, contain what the title-pages do not
contain, and as there is no indication of intended abbrevi-
ations‚ the transcriptions are of necessity wrong. From
these cases one is left in doubt when etc. occurs in the
course of a title, as for instance in No. 211, whether it
really exists in the original, or whether it is inserted for
brevity by Mook. Such doubt, of course, should never be
possible in the description of a book taken from an actual
copy. That all the misprints and curtailments are to be
put to the anthor's credit cannot be avoided, for only on
two or three occasi0ns has he indicated, by the word sic,
the existence os an original mistake in what he was tran-
scribing. The last part of the catalogue contains the titles
of twenty-eight MSS. of treatises by Paracelsus‚ none of
which, however. are original, and most of which are late.
These MSS. are preserved in the Bern, British Museum,
Darmstadt‚ Giessen, Munich, Paris, T'ubingen, and Utrecht
libraries. The titles of certain of these run thus, according
to Mook :

8. Archicatholik pwigr etc. of Paracelsus Archidoxes.

9. The Thendt Book of Archidoxis of Philippus Theophrastus
Paracelsus.

10. The Philosophiea Canons of Paracelsus.

12. Magick Archidoxis Booke's. Philippus Theophrastus Para-
celsus Phisitian and Philosopher his Magik Archidoxis Bookes.

ls it likely that these titles are correct?

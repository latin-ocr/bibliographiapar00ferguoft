I.

PARACELSIAN BIBLIOGRAPHY

continued.

g 1. The following are the titles of books attributed to
Paracelsus‚ which have come into my possession since
printing Part II. of this research, and the method of descrip-
tion hitherto followed has been continued. The tities are
brought forward now not to make further display of Mook's
defects, but to increase the tale of Paracelsus’ works, so far
as I can, by examination of them myself3 simply, therefore,
as a record of facts for reference and comparison. But, in
describing a Paracelsian book it is impossible, as it is un-
advisable, to overlook what Mook may have said about it,
and to refrain from indicating wherein his account agrees or
disagrees with the copy under consideration, and it will not
fail to be observed that, as on almost every previous
occasion, so on this, though Mook has described the books
after personal inspection‚ he has done so in a strangely,
almost unaccountably, inaccurate way, and thus the new
titles give additional force to all that Ι have already said
relative to the imperfectioris of Mook's work. In fact, with
almost every fresh title, the mistakes multiply. Believing,
as I did at first, that the discrepancies which I had observed,
originated in carelessness and inattention, I thought it only
fair to the writers with whom M ool< had found fault, that the
shortcomings of their critic should not be allowed to pass

the nature and succession of rocks, the physical properties
of minerals, ores, and metals; he got a notion of mineral
waters; he was an eye-witness of the accidents which
befel the miners, and studied the diseases which attacked
them; he had proof that positive knowledge of nature
was not to be got in schools and universities‚ but only
by going to Nature herself, and to those who were con-
stantly engaged with her. Hence carne Paracelsus’
peculias mode of study. He attached no value to mere
scholarship; scholastic disputations he utterly ignored
and despiscd,—-and especially the discussions on medical
topics, which turned more upon theories and definitions
than upon actual practice. He therefore went wandering
over a great part of Europe to learn all that he could.
In so doing he was one of the first physicians of modern
times to profit by a mode of study which is now
reckoned indispensable. In the 16th century the difficulty
of moving about was much greater than it is now; still
Paracelsus faccd it, and on principle. The book of nature,
he affirmed, is that which the physician must read, and
to do so he must walk over the leaves, The humours
and passions and diseases of different nations are different,
and the physician must go among the nations if he will be
master of his art; the more he knows of other nations,
the better he will understand his own. For the physician
it is ten times more necessary and useful to know the
powers of the heavens and the earth, the virtues of plants
and minerals, than to spend his time on Greek and Latin
grammar. And the commentary of his own and succeed-
ing centuries upon these very extreme views is *that
Paracelsus was no scholar, but an ignorant vagabond.

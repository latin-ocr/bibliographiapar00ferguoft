ten quartos. All these works were collected and published
after his death, and much that is spurious has got in-
separably mixed up with what Paracelsus may have
thought, written, or dictated to his pupils and immediate
followers. When even Oporinus says that words were
ascribed to Paracelsus which, in his most fantastic or
drunken hours, he never imagined, much less dictated,
we may assume that some of these less authentic passages
are just what would most likely be quoted to his detri-
ment by those adverse to his innovations.l It is indeed
singular with what unanimity the same statements are
repeated over and over again, every other ten or twenty
years, by the author of a new biography, a literary, or
scientific dictionary. So that the repetition by some dozen
writers of Paracelsus’ failings does not substantiate their
existence, but only proves that they have all drawn in-
dependently from one source, or, as is more likely, that
they have drawn from it through each other.

They may, however, be excused, Folio volumes are
not attractive reading, and, with the exception of some
diligent historians who have consulted the originals, no
one now thinks of studying Paracelsus' writings. The
doctrines which he tried to enunciate are under no small
obligations to those who have systematized what is dis-

tinguished for its want of all system—who have arranged

1A modern biographer of Paracelsus has tried to reduce the list
of his authentic works to ten tracts; some of them, like that Van
dem Bad Psffrs, consisting of a few pages only. The older critics
are willing to admit that the writings are not all genuine3 for example,
Conring, who made a fierce attack upon Pamcelsus, follows Oporinus
